The main character Eda Sou\u010dek  attends a boys' elementary school where he belongs to a class with a complete lack of discipline. After their teacher Maxov\u00e1  goes insane during one of her classes, the schoolmaster  has to implement special measures. He employs a new male teacher Igor Hn\u00edzdo , who is said to be a great war hero. Authoritative Hn\u00edzdo immediately introduces corporal punishment which, as he explains, is not normally allowed but the school has received an exception from the Ministry of Education as a result of their dreadful behaviour. Despite his strict methods, the boys soon become charmed by the man. They love his battlefront stories and the fact that he is always armed and wears a uniform. Eda sees him as the very opposite of his own father  whom he considers to be too cowardly. Hn\u00edzdo makes the same positive impression on all people he meets . Nevertheless, his persona is also surrounded by many controversies. For example his war heroism is disputed as he is unable to provide any accurate information about his military service. There is even an unconfirmed rumour that Hn\u00edzdo was only guarding goats during the war. But the boys from his class ignore all negative comments and even fight those who are spreading the rumours. Hn\u00edzdo's reputation suffers after he is accused of having a sexual relationship with local twins who attend a girls' school in the same area. He is forced to leave because this is not the first time he has been involved in a similar affair. The formerly unmanageable boys begin to defend Hn\u00edzdo and call for his return. The accusation is finally withdrawn and Hn\u00edzdo comes back to the class. He states that the way they were dealing with the accusation is a proof that the physical punishments are no longer necessary.\n"}
