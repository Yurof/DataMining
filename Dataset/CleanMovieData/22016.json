Zano is meant to be brooding and profound to the point of being sulky, and world-hating and Naima wildly passionate to the point of being slutty and insane; and both far too self-absorbed to care about either one of the other. The pair travel from France, down through Spain toward Algeria but get lost many times along the way. They work as fruit pickers for a while, allowing for a naughty sex scene in the orchard.\n"}
