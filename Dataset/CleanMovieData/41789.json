{"wikiId": "15223564", "titre": "The Barretts of Wimpole Street", "dateSortie": "1957-01-16", "duree": "105.0", "genre": ["Drama"], "resume": "Elizabeth Barrett  is the disabled grown-up daughter of Edward Moulton-Barrett  of Wimpole Street, and has an intense interest in poetry. However, she lives under the obsessive rule of her father, and this severely limits her ability to develop her love of rhyme amongst her peers. Edward in fact shows clear incestuous tendencies towards her, and discourages close contact with any males. When the poet Robert Browning  enters her life, though, matters are brought to a head, through the intervention of Browning. Edward finds that his control over Elizabeth, and her younger sister Henrietta , is far from complete.\n"}
