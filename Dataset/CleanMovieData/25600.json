Charged with delivering a serum to stem an outbreak of infantile paralysis in Rio de Janeiro, Auguste Pellerin (Robert Montgomery  conquers his fears, but is reprimanded by the airline's stern director, A. Rivi\u00e9re  for coming in late. Determined to make the night flight program work, Rivi\u00e9re has sent pilot Jules Fabian  and his wireless operator on another dangerous flight. The pair are caught in a torrential rain storm and when Madame Fabian  comes to the headquarters, she realizes that her husband is overdue. The two airmen, flying blind over the ocean, run out of fuel and choose to jump but are drowned. Rivi\u00e9re refuses to quit and orders a Brazilian pilot  to take the mail to Rio, but the pilot's wife  pleads with him not to go. Despite the dangers, the night mail is delivered on time. The pilot despairs that his flight only meant that someone in Paris can get a postcard on Tuesday instead of Thursday, but its real value is proven when the serum is also delivered and a child is saved.\n"}
