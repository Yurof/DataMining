World War II is over, but it doesn't mean that there is no one to fight with. The post-war city of Odessa is ruled by serial killer prison-escapees and former Nazi collaborators. Fallen into disfavor, Marshal Zhoukov is sent to Odessa by Joseph Stalin to handle the situation. Together with the head of the local criminal investigation unit, David Gottsman, Zhoukov begins a special operation under the code name \"Liquidation\".  Marshal Zhukov, the newly appointed head of the Odessa Military District, arrives in the city, and Odessa\u2019s leaders immediately begin to feel the iron grip of the Marshal of Victory. During the night before his arrival, the Criminal Investigation Unit manages to arrest members of Senka Shalov\u2019s gang. Running the operation was Lt. Colonel David Gottsman, the head of the Criminal Investigation Unit for the battle against banditry. All of Gottsman\u2019s family and close friends perished during the war. Only his two childhood friends remain \u2013 shell-shocked pilot Mark, and Phima Petrov, ex-pickpocket who became Gottsman\u2019s willing assistant. It was Phima who discovered Senka Shalov, making him show the place where Shalov\u2019s gang hid their stolen goods. Near this place, in the ruins, Phima, with the help of homeless boy Mishka Karas\u2019, finds a deposit of thousands of military goods. Gottsman gives the news to the Military Command, but Prosecutor Naimov declines to investigate, stating that he is busy. And at night, the now guarded deposit sees the arrival of an unknown truck\u2026  At night, the now guarded deposit sees the arrival of a truck with an unknown Captain. The guards are shot, and the military goods stolen. Chasing the truck proves fruitless. The bandits set fire to the truck and run it off a cliff. One bandit named Eva Radzakis is killed; the rest escape. It is discovered that Phima hid several of the military goods at his home prior to the raid by the bandits. Using his contacts in the underbelly of Odessa, Phima, through the labels on the military goods, is able to find out the factory they were stolen from. He even finds a fake import licence that the bandits used to transport the goods, and brings it to Rodya, a counterfeiter. Rodya tells Phima that he can\u2019t help him.  The case of the stolen military goods takes a tragic turn of events \u2013 Phima Petrov is murdered. Phima was David Gottsman\u2019s close friend and actively aided the investigation. There are almost no leads anywhere in the case, so Gottsman travels to a meeting of the leaders of Thief\u2019s Odessa. He asks them to find the man with the Captain\u2019s uniform and with a scar at his left temple, who turned up several times in the investigation. Gottsman\u2019s authority is so wide that the thieves agree to help. They discovered that this person is Chekan, a bandit who appeared in Odessa before the war. It is also discovered that a certain \u201cAcademic\u201d is behind the murders and robberies. Only a contrabandist, nicknamed Greying Greek, knows of the Academic. However, Greying Greek\u2019s arrest is to be postponed, as Gottsman\u2019s group is unexpectedly ordered to guard Marshal Zhukov, who is outside in the city. In the crowd surrounding Zhukov, Gottsman once again bumps into Mishka Karas\u2019, who, in front of everyone, steals Zhukov\u2019s watch.  The case of the stolen military goods continues grow, but all leads seem to get cut off \u2013 the goods were burnt in the truck, Phima was found murdered, Greying Greek was finally arrested, but was shot dead during his transport to the station. The only real discovery was that the operations were led by the bandit Chekan, and that the mastermind behind them was some secret \u201cAcademic\u201d. At night, Chekan\u2019s gang attempt to take away weapons from a military deposit, but are caught by password checks put in place by the city\u2019s Military Quartermaster, Vorobyov. The bandits escape with a fire fight, and in two hours, Quartermaster Vorobyov is found murdered. According to doctor Arsenin, the murderers wanted to imitate a suicide. Due to the difficulty of the case, Gottsman\u2019s group is strengthened with another member \u2013 Prosecutor\u2019s Assistant Major Vitaliy Krechetov. Simultaneously, the Counterintelligence Unit discovers that Chekan was educated at a German intelligence school, where he met a top-secret agent nicknamed \u201cAcademic\u201d, but no-one questioned has seen the \u201cAcademic\u201d face to face. During an attempt to arrest Chekan, two Counterintelligence agents are killed, and Chekan escapes. Chekan\u2019s girlfriend, Ida, convinces him to run away with the contrabandists to Turkey, but this does not fit in with the \u201cAcademic\u2019s\u201d plans\u2026  Following Chekan\u2019s attempt to leave Odessa, but Chekan\u2019s assistant, Anatoly Zhivchik, informs Shtekhel, another bandit. Ida is taken prisoner, and Chekan is given a new task \u2013 selling criminals TT pistols. As a result of the new weapons, Odessa is once again drowned in a wave of murders and robberies. Within several days, Gottsman discovers that the weapons are passing through Chekan. Gottsman is told this by a sharper, nicknamed Sasha-I-Don\u2019t-Know. He tells Gottsman the location and time of the next delivery of weapons. An ambush is planned, but Chekan doesn\u2019t turn up to the meeting. It becomes evident that an informant is working within the ranks of the Criminal Investigation Unit. Major Dovjik, of the CIU, finds a chance to place a rat in the gang \u2013 arrested bandit Senka Shalov. However, Gottsman himself is arrested by the NGB, having entered a dispute with Marshal Zhukov during a conference, and been sent out by the Marshal. Within an hour, a case concerning an anti-Soviet plot is fabricated against Gottsman.  Marshal Zhukov doesn\u2019t forget the shrewd head of the CI Unit. Zhukov closes the anti-Soviet case, and releases Gottsman. It seems that everything bad is in the past. Gottsman adopts ex-homeless boy and pickpocket Mishka Karas\u2019, now a pupil of a boarding school for gifted children. All-loved singer Leonid Utyosov arrives for a single concert in Odessa. The whole city turns up, and, as a sign of respect, the city announces a non-working day. It turns out that Utyosov\u2019s unexpected arrival is part of Marshal Zhukov\u2019s plan. The concert is unexpectedly interrupted, and the leaders of Thief\u2019s Odessa are arrested. The Military Counter Intelligence Unit NGB is behind the operation, but Chekan\u2019s gang was preparing as well. The \u201cAcademic\u201d, obviously knowing of Zhukov\u2019s operation, decides to make use of the Marshal\u2019s mistake. When riots in Odessa begin, Chekan sends his gang, together with the rioters, to military weapons deposits\u2026  Zhukov\u2019s blunder gives unexpected results \u2013 the arrest of Thief\u2019s Odessa\u2019s leaders leads to mass riots. Weapons deposits are robbed, and a fresh wave of banditry descends upon Odessa. Through Senka Shalov, the CI Unit discovers where Chekan is hiding, but counterfeiter Rodya interrupts the arrest. Chekan escapes once again, and Rodya is taken to the station. During the interrogation, a call, apparently from Major Dovjik who stayed at the arrest site, comes through, requesting that Gottsman come at once. Rodya is locked in an iron closet, at Gottsman\u2019s request. When Gottsman and Krechetov return, Rodya is found strangled with a necklace cord. David Gottsman figures out his killer, Army Guard Luzhov. It becomes obvious that Luzhov wasn\u2019t acting alone, and that the accomplice is close by. During an escape attempt, Luzhov is shot dead by Gottsman\u2019s assistant Captain Yekimenko.  After several troublesome days, Marshal Zhukov realises that it is necessary to take extreme measures. Gottsman recommends immediately releasing Odessa\u2019s thieves. He is supported by the head of the Counter Intelligence Unit Colonel Chusov, although, in a private meeting with Zhukov, Chusov admits his intent to deal with Odessa\u2019s crime personally. The thieves are released under strict conditions dictated by Gottsman \u2013 namely, to call off their gangs and return the stolen weapons. The thieves agree, and Odessa becomes temporarily quiet. Acting on Krechetov\u2019s advice, Gottsman invites Nora, Phima\u2019s ex-roommate, to the theatre, but Nora doesn\u2019t arrive. Something was pushing her away from Gottsman; something was preventing her from coming to him. Meanwhile, the bandits seem to be one step ahead of the investigation. Gottsman continuously summons his co-workers, attempting to reconstruct in detail the chain of events on the day when Rodya was killed, and each person\u2019s place in that chain. It was now known that, without a doubt, the \u201cAcademic\u201d  is working within the walls of the CI Unit.  Marshal Zhukov orders the commencement of Operation \u201cMasquerade\u201d- military investigators were dressed in expensive suits, and given money and a weapon. A day before the beginning of the operation, an assassination attempt was carried out on Gottsman. By a happy coincidence, Gottsman spent the night at Krechetov\u2019s house, and a distant relative dies instead of Gottsman. However, news of Gottsman\u2019s alleged death spreads through Odessa like wildfire. Thieves immediately relax and begin to commit crime with a new spirit. At the same time, Victor Platov appears in Odessa. Platov was a platoon leader in Gottsman\u2019s command, and, before the war, got involved in Odessa\u2019s criminal underbelly. Platov immediately visits the owner of a gambling house. Meanwhile, Gottsman has no doubt of a traitor within the ranks of the CI Unit. Everyone seems to fall into his circle of suspects \u2013 Captain Yekimenko, who shot Luzhov dead, Major Dovjik, with his strange contacts in the criminal world, and war doctor Arsenin, who served in the Far East and who was, on more than one occasion, interested in the investigation.  Bandits are constantly ambushed and shot in Odessa, as a result of Operation \u201cMasquerade\u201d. It quickly becomes apparent to Gottsman that the operation was planned by the Counterintelligence Unit \u2013 the investigators didn\u2019t miss when they shot, and were silent when interrogated. Captain Rusnochenko recognises Chekan on a tram. A fire fight ensues, which ends with Rusnochenko\u2019s arrest, Riboglaziy, another bandit, being shot dead and Chekan\u2019s escape. While investigating Riboglaziy\u2019s shooting, Major Dovjik locates a flat where Ida is hiding. Ida refuses to betray Chekan, but agrees to show the CI Unit where the stolen weapons are hidden. One day before, Dovjik brought Gottsman to a strange old psychiatrist. The blind man specialised in psychoanalysis, who, during Nazi occupation, worked with the Germans in an intelligence school. He knew several things about the \u201cAcademic\u201d, but his description was vague and unclear, suiting almost any member of the CI Unit \u2013 Dovjik, who suspiciously quickly and easily found Ida, Yekimenko, who, as a sniper, strangely missed and killed Luzhov, and Vitaliy Krechetov, who worked as an investigator at the Second Belorussian Front, but somehow didn\u2019t remember a scandalous criminal case in 1943.  War doctor Arsenin discovers that Major Krechetov didn\u2019t serve at the Second Belorussian Front. This is confirmed by Gottsman\u2019s new driver, and appears as a serious argument against Krechetov. Along with other facts, this points to one conclusion \u2013 that Krechetov is the \u201cAcademic\u201d, and Gottsman receives a warrant for his arrest, but Gottsman\u2019s conclusion turns out to be hasty. Krechetov reveals that he served as part of a group of commanding subfield personnel, together with the Secretary of the UWB and other equally important people. Colonel Chusov, head of the Counterintelligence Unit, confirms Krechetov\u2019s story. Krechetov remembers the knot that was used to strangle Rodya \u2013 a Samurai\u2019s knot, which points to doctor Arsenin, who served in the Far East. Arsenin seemingly disappears. Chekan\u2019s girlfriend Ida brings detectives to the place where Chekan\u2019s stolen weapons are hidden, but Chekan organises an ambush and recaptures Ida. Meanwhile, the nightly shootings continue. As a result of Operation \u201cMasquerade\u201d, hundreds of thieves and gangsters are killed. Each day, Odessa buries more and more people.  The CI Unit continues to search for war doctor Arsenin, but all their attempts are fruitless. The \u201cAcademic\u201d, who turns out to be Krechetov after all, cuts all leads to the doctor. Gottsman suggests a course of action to Colonel Chusov, with the first part of the plan being to end Operation \u201cMasquerade\u201d. Chusov listens to Gottsman, and informs Marshal Zhukov of his thoughts. Meanwhile, the \u201cAcademic\u201d, Vitaliy Krechetov, tells Shtekhel that he is being suspected, and that his gang needs to lay low for a while, waiting for further orders. Ex-criminal Victor Platov is searched by Chekan\u2019s orders, but the search ends before it can begin \u2013 Platov shoots Chekan\u2019s gangsters dead. Gottsman understands that the plan he suggested to Chusov was highly dangerous, and that it could easily backfire on him. Colonel Chusov unexpectedly arrives at the CI Station and arrests Gottsman.  Vitaliy Krechetov, the \u201cAcademic\u201d, feels that a major failure was close by and unavoidable. However, at the last moment, the situation shifts to a largely favourable situation for him \u2013 the Counterintelligence Unit arrests Gottsman and his wife, Nora. Operation \u201cMasquerade\u201d is concluded, and military investigators begin to leave town. Shortly afterwards, Marshal Zhukov announces military training in Moldavia, which means that, in several days, only the sentinel garrison and the police will be patrolling the city. Krechetov realises that he has a real chance to carry out a well-conceived operation and capture Odessa. He also realises that his own gang forces will be inadequate, and that he needs the aid of gang units operating in the forest. Krechetov recruits the help of a contact from Kiev, who turns out to be Victor Platov.  Krechetov\u2019s wife Antonina follows him to a meeting with Chekan. Realising that he is a traitor, she confronts Krechetov, who stabs her to death. Meanwhile, Anatoly Zhivchik, Chekan\u2019s assistant, hands out Red Army uniforms and weapons to various gang members, enabling them to pose as military personnel as part of Krechetov\u2019s plan. Victor Platov rendezvous with the forest gangs, handing out uniforms to them as well. As Krechetov, Chekan and Zhivchik prepare to capture Odessa, they realise that it is filled with disguised Counterintelligence agents. Zhivchik is arrested, and Chekan manages to inform Krechetov before he is shot and severely injured in a fire fight with a Counterintelligence agent. Gottsman arrives and arrests Krechetov, informing his that his [Gottsman\u2019s] arrest was a red herring. Captain Yekimenko, together with a division of snipers and machine-gunners, intercepts three trucks with the disguised forest gang members. Victor Platov, who turns out to be a double-agent working for Counterintelligence, is shot and injured by the forest gang leader during the intercept. All gang members are disarmed and arrested. Meanwhile, Gottsman reveals to Krechetov that the knot used to murder Rodya was not, in fact, Japanese, and that this is what gave Krechetov away. When asking for a cigarette, Krechetov grabs a hidden pistol and shoots the two arresting officers, taking Gottsman hostage. Meanwhile, on a steamer ship, Shtekhel, Ida and several gangsters spot Chekan in a rowboat. Shtekhel orders a gangster to shoot Chekan, tying up loose ends. Ida attacks the gangster, who stabs her to death. Her body is placed in the rowboat, but Shtekhel realises that he hasn\u2019t taken her purse. As he descends into the rowboat, the gangsters shoot him. Krechetov reveals to Gottsman that he killed Phima and doctor Arsenin, burying the latter\u2019s body at sea. Krechetov then attempts to pass by the police by keeping Gottsman at gunpoint, but Gottsman pushes him off a ledge onto a vertical steel pipe, which impales Krechetov. As Krechetov\u2019s body is carried away, Gottsman travels to a military boarding school, where he watches Mishka in the school\u2019s choir. The narrator\u2019s voiceover states that \u201cno one knows where the truth and where the fiction in this story lies, and whether this story happened at all, know only the chestnuts on the French boulevard, the Black Sea and the city of Odessa\u2026\u201d\n"}
