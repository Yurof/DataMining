The cartoon was kept out of commercial release for years due to its racially offensive caricaturing of the Japanese and to the climactic sequence where the Japanese naval commander commits suicide by drinking gasoline and consuming lit firecrackers. However, it re-emerged in a November 2008 DVD release of Popeye cartoons produced between 1941 to 1943.\n"}
