Angelo shocks his parents - and his sister, Anna - by moving out on his own without getting married, and, shortly after that, shocks them further still when he reveals as gay. But his boyfriend , policeman Nino Paventi, isn't as ready to come out of the closet - especially not to his busybody Sicilian mother, Lina.\n"}
