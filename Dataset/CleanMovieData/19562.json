A recent New York City transplant, Sequan Greene  has been sent to live in Alabama after the recent death of his mother. He is brutally raped by his cousin Michael Wilis . It becomes clear that Michael also is gay - a victim as well as a victimizer. He says, \"I can\u2019t be a faggot ...You\u2019re the faggot. You\u2019re my faggot.\" Sequan is also bullied and beaten up at school. Sequan soon finds a friend in Lori Anderson , the girlfriend of drug dealer/basketball player Ahmed Robins . Lori is the town's \"bad girl\" who has a heart of gold. Although she freebases, snorts coke throughout the school day, steals guns and sleeps with the town basketball star, she is immediately taken by admiration of Sequan and his brazen nonconformity. Despite Sequan\u2019s unwillingness, Lori manages to befriend him, bringing him out of his shell and eventually introducing him to both moonshine and her gay brother, Jake .\n"}
