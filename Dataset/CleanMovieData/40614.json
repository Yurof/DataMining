A nighttime set is prepared for a sequence that Fellini defines as \u201cthe prisoner\u2019s dream\u201d in which his hands grope for a way out of a dark tunnel. With advancing age and weight, Fellini is finding it difficult to escape by simply flying away but when he does, he contemplates Cinecitt\u00e0 from a great height. The next morning, Fellini accompanies the Japanese TV crew on a brief tour of the studios. As they walk past absurd TV commercials in production, Fellini\u2019s casting director presents him with four young actors she\u2019s found to interpret Karl Rossmann, the leading role in the maestro's film version of Kafka\u2019s Amerika. Fellini introduces the Japanese to the female custodian of Cinecitt\u00e0  but she succeeds in putting off the interview by disappearing into the deserted backlot of Studio 5 to gather dandelions to make herbal tea. Meanwhile, Fellini\u2019s assistant director  is on location with other crew members at the Casa del Passeggero, a once cheap hotel now converted into a drugstore. Fellini wants to include it in his film about the first time he visited Cinecitt\u00e0 as a journalist in 1938 during the Fascist era.Interviewed by Alain Finkielkraut for the Messager europ\u00e9en, Fellini explained that the \u201cfirst time I visited Cinecitt\u00e0, I was 18 years old, a journalist from Rimini who considered Cinecitt\u00e0 as something legendary.\u201d In Fellini, Intervista, 228. Past and present intermingle as Fellini interacts with his younger self played by aspiring actor, Sergio Rubini. After the crew reconstruct the facade of the Casa del Passeggero elsewhere in Rome, a fake tramway takes young Fellini/Rubini from America\u2019s Far West with Indian warriors on a clifftop to a herd of wild elephants off the coast of Ethiopia. Arriving at Cinecitt\u00e0, he sets off to interview matinee idol, Greta Gonda.\"I came to interview an actress named Greta Gonda and it was the first interview I conducted, the first time I went to Cinecitt\u00e0, and the first encounter with an actress I liked very much.\u201d Fellini, Intervista, 228 Seamlessly, the illusion takes over the realities of moviemaking as the viewer is thrown into two feature films being directed by tyrannical directors. But only for a short while; for the rest of the film, Fellini and his assistant director  scramble to recruit the right cast and build the sets for the film version of Amerika, a fictitious adaptation that Fellini uses as a pretext to shoot his film-in-progress. This allows Fellini/Rubini to go back and forth in time to experience filmmaking first-hand including disgruntled actors who failed their auditions, Marcello Mastroianni in a TV commercial as Mandrake the Magician, a bomb threat, a visit to Anita Ekberg\u2019s house where she and Mastroianni re-live their La Dolce Vita scenes, screen tests of Kafka\u2019s Brunelda caressed in a bathtub by two young men, and an inconvenient thunderstorm that heralds the production collapse of Amerika with an attack by bogus Indians on horseback wielding television antennae as spears. Back inside Studio 5 at Cinecitt\u00e0, Intervista concludes with Fellini\u2019s voiceover, \u201cSo the movie should end here. Actually, it\u2019s finished.\u201d In response to producers unhappy with his gloomy endings, the Maestro ironically offers them a ray of sunshine by lighting an arc lamp.\n"}
