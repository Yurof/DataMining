Later in life, a dying woman tells a reporter the tale of how she thinks the accident was actually murder. The young American reporter, Mary Roberts, begins investigating the case, unaware that the charming lawyer may be behind it all. Meanwhile Michel Lacoste, a classical composer, who is supported by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, is having marriage troubles. Finally his wife kills herself and leaves the husband a note. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric sneaks into the apartment, takes the note and convinces the man that he killed her in a drunken rage. Michel, whose night was indeed blacked out by drink, can't remember anything. The lawyer then offers the composer a deal: Kill reporter Mary Roberts in exchange for legal representation that will guarantee to get the younger man off the hook. The man, seeing no other choice, agrees reluctantly. The man and woman meet but he can't kill her. In fact, they begin to fall in love. Instead they figure out that the lawyer is the killer and set about a scheme to drive the lawyer into confessing to the crime.\n"}
