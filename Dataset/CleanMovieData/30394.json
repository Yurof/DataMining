{"wikiId": "15532008", "titre": "The Judge and the General", "dateSortie": "2008-05-04", "duree": "84.0", "genre": ["Documentary"], "resume": "The Judge and the General tells a story of personal transformation, as a Chilean judge descends into what he calls the \"abyss\" of investigating crimes committed by Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship during the 1970s and 1980s in Chile. Appeals Court Judge Juan Guzm\u00e1n opposed the democratically elected Salvador Allende and supported General Pinochet until being assigned in 1998\u2014by judicial lottery\u2014the first criminal cases against him.  Filmmakers Elizabeth Farnsworth and Patricio Lanfranco follow Guzm\u00e1n's investigations as he solves cases of murder and kidnapping and considers whether to indict Pinochet. Viewers watch as Guzm\u00e1n confronts his past collusion with the military government and faces his own doubts about whether Pinochet should be indicted or not. The documentary begins with Judge Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s expressions of anguish, as he watches supporters of Pinochet taunt opponents during the general\u2019s funeral in Santiago in December 2006. The taunts \u2013 which laud the killings of the Pinochet years\u2014take Guzm\u00e1n back to the hatred and chaos of the Allende period, the 1973 Pinochet coup, and ensuing terror. The film flashes back briefly to those years, as Guzm\u00e1n and others recall that time. The film then follows two investigations which take viewers deeply into the story. Manuel Donoso was a young sociology professor killed just after the coup. The documentary cuts back and forth between a disinterment of Donoso\u2019s remains and his wife\u2019s story, as she recounts his arrest, torture and death. The case widens out as the documentary moves between past and present, and other characters place the crime in context. The other key case features Cecilia  Castro, whose mother, Edita, faced a ghastly \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice.\u201d She led Pinochet\u2019s secret police to her daughter\u2019s hiding place in order to save a granddaughter\u2019s life. Judge Guzm\u00e1n and detectives investigate this case from, among other locations, a boat off the Chilean coast, where underwater cameras capture the shocking images of divers bringing up rails that had been tied to bodies of political prisoners thrown into the sea. Guzm\u00e1n is, perhaps, \u201cthe good German,\u201d a citizen blind to the crimes around him until chance forces him into an investigation he never sought and didn\u2019t want. As a young man he had served briefly as a clerk in the Court of Appeals during the worst years of repression under Pinochet. Judges of that court had to decide on thousands of habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of victims, many of whom had disappeared into secret detention centers. Nearly all the petitions were denied, and Juan Guzm\u00e1n wrote some of those denials. Had they been granted, many lives would have been saved. Viewers watch as he struggles with this memory and describes how his investigation made him realize how \u201cblind\u201d he had been. \u201c I would say it opened the eyes of my soul,\u201d he says. Guzman\u2019s colleagues\u2013-attorneys and judges\u2014had doubted Guzman\u2019s competence and his willingness to pursue Pinochet. By the end of the film, viewers will know whether they were right or wrong.\n"}
