{"wikiId": "4399566", "titre": "Beatrice Wood: Mama of Dada", "dateSortie": "1993-10-01", "duree": "55.0", "genre": ["Documentary"], "resume": "The documentary details the life and work of the artist Beatrice Wood, particularly her experiences as one of the members of the art movement known as Dada during the 1910s. It also recounts friendships with Marcel Duchamp and Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9 whose book, and subsequent film Jules and Jim, was no doubt inspired by the relationship between the three of them, but actually based on a later relationship between Roch\u00e9, Helen Grund and the German writer Franz Hessel. Various art consultants, artists, and owners of art galleries who have exhibited Wood's art consulted on the film and were interviewed.\n"}
