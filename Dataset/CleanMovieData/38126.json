His mother Annie  works as a cleaning woman in the high school gym: After this they have a tough time financially. Not a great student, Mickael excels in judo and his life is focused on his sport and on his girlfriend Vanessa . One of Mickael's teammates Cl\u00e9ment  is from a wealthy family: his father Louis Steiner  uses a wheelchair and his mother Mathilde  is a woman of the world and society. Louis decides to sponsor the judo team, buys them outfits, and asks Mickael to work with Clement to perfect his technique and prepare the judo team for a French championship. Mickael and Cl\u00e9ment relate well and while Mickael is a winning player, Cl\u00e9ment is smarter and understands the intrinsic rules of the game better. An incident occurs that forces Mickael to take the position of a wounded team mate and in doing so he must lose eight kilos to qualify for the championship team. The struggle to lose weight  places stress on both Mickael and his family and teammates. Mickael and Vanessa include Cl\u00e9ment in their camaraderie, a situation which evolves into a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois as the three have group sex in the after hours gym. Controversially, the two male stars show their genitals. Vanessa reacts as though this is the greatest physical feeling ever, Cl\u00e9ment is smitten, and Mickael has troubling doubts. When the three decide to try it again in a hotel room Mickael is so conflicted that he does not join the other two, only listening to their cavorting in the bathtub feeling inferior to the smarter, wealthier Cl\u00e9ment. But on the judo side, the team plays the championship and Mickael's delicate sense of self worth is restored for a moment. It is the manner in which the trio of teenagers resolve their antics that closes the film.\n"}
