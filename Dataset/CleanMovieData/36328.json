In hospital, Livia Horv\u00e1th, bandaged around her neck is recuperating, and is told that she will be unable to live her life as before; the reason is not made explicit. The lesbian \u00c9va, already known to the authorities for her private life, begins a new job as a journalist at The Truth, a weekly periodical, and meets the married Livia when the two women share an office. The attraction is immediate, but Livia is initially resistant. Late at night, while kissing in darkness on a park bench, the women are discovered by a policeman, who warns Livia that her husband and employer will be informed if she is found in the same uncompromising position again. \u00c9va is arrested, but soon released. At a collective farm, \u00c9va finds the authorities have blocked an attempt at a more democratic way of organising their cooperative venture. Her understanding editor, a supporter of the short-lived government of the recently executed Imre Nagy, refuses to publish the article, and she resigns before she is sacked. \u00c9va and Livia have a brief affair. The previously mild D\u00f6nci Horv\u00e1th, an army officer, shoots his wife while she in the bath after her confession of love for \u00c9va. Livia survives and her husband is imprisoned for the offence. At the hospital, Livia rejects \u00c9va, who then journeys to the countryside. At night, \u00c9va is challenged to stop walking by border guards, but is shot dead when she fails to do.\n"}
