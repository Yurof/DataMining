The scene of the police shooting parrots in the bush skillfully positions the shooter in the middle ground to the left of the image, firing upwards toward the far right, with the gang watching him from close foreground. The capture of Ned is shot from the viewpoint of the police, as Ned advances, an impressive figure weaving towards them under the weight of his armour and the shock of the bullets. According to the synopsis given in the surviving program, the film originally comprised six sequences. Some confusion regarding the plot has emerged as a result of a variant poster from the film dating from 1910. Its similar  photos suggest that either the film was being added to, or altered, or an entirely new version was made by Johnson and Gibson, as the poster proclaims.http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/provcasts/images/NedKellyPosterBefore2.jpg Fragments of another version of the story, \u201cthe Perth fragment,\u201d shows Aaron Sherritt being shot outside, in front of an obviously painted canvas flat. This now appears to be from a different film altogether, perhaps a cheap imitation by a theatrical company, keen to cash in on the success of the original.Ina Bertrand and Ken Robb  \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\".
