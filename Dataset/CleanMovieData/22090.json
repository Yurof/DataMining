Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was arrested on charges of murder and convicted largely on the testimony of one man. However, the man was a close relative of the victim who had no firm evidence against Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, while the accused produced several witnesses able to place him far from the scene of the crime at the time of the murder. Despite this, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was found guilty, and when lawyers Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez and Layda Negrete learned about his case, they agreed to help him. After it was revealed that the lawyer appointed to represent Z\u00fa\u00f1iga did not have a valid license to practice law, authorities grudgingly agreed to a new trial, but with the same judge presiding. This judge showed little interest in evidence that Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was falsely convicted. Battling an arrogant judge, uncooperative witnesses and a legal system riddled with corruption, Hern\u00e1ndez and Negrete found that it was easy to prove Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's innocence, but hard to get the authorities to acknowledge this fact. Presumed Guilty was a selection at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. The story of Presumed Guilty was made into an episode of the TV series \"P.O.V.\" that aired on 27 July 2010.\n"}
