The bus is owned by Krsti\u0107 Sr., and driven by his impressionable son Mi\u0161ko. Along the way, they are joined by a priest and a pair of young newlyweds who are on their way to the seaside for their honeymoon, and are faced with numerous difficulties: a flat tire, a shaky bridge, a farmer who's ploughed over the road, a funeral, two feuding families, Krsti\u0107 Jr.'s recruitment into the army, and a lost wallet. All these slow the bus down and expose rifts among the travelers. During the early morning of Sunday, 6 April, amid rumours of war, they finally reach Belgrade only to be caught in the middle of Luftwaffe's raid . The only surviving passengers are two Gypsy musicians who sing the film's theme song before the end.\n"}
