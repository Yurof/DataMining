{"wikiId": "1775698", "titre": "Jam\u00f3n, jam\u00f3n", "dateSortie": "1992", "duree": "94.0", "genre": ["Comedy"], "resume": "Silvia, a beautiful girl, prepares omelettes for the workers in the underwear factory owned by Jos\u00e9 Luis' family. After missing two periods, Silvia reveals to Jos\u00e9 that she is pregnant, expecting him to react negatively. However, to Silvia's surprise and delight, Jos\u00e9 Luis expresses his love for her and desire for her to go through with the pregnancy. He romantically picks up the ring from a soda can he finds on the ground and places it on her finger and tells her they will get married. Despite the apparent monetary worthlessness of this item, Silvia cherishes it and all that it symbolises. Jos\u00e9 Luis has a difficult time explaining to his overbearing and conniving mother that he is in love with Silvia and intends to marry her. His mother, Conchita, does not approve and when her husband refuses to help her by intervening, she takes matters into her own hands. She hires Ra\u00fal, an underwear model who works for the family business, to seduce Silvia, hoping this will destroy the relationship and prevent the marriage. In spite of several aggressive attempts by Raul to seduce Silvia, she remains committed to marry Jos\u00e9 Luis. Ra\u00fal however, becomes genuinely infatuated with Silvia while Conchita's lust for Ra\u00fal leads her to offer him anything he wants if only he has sex with her. Ra\u00fal's choice is a Yamaha FZR600 motorbike so, despite his apparent lack of interest in Conchita, he becomes her lover. Meanwhile, Jos\u00e9 Luis's inability to come to a decision about whether to marry Silvia without his mother's approval, leads to Silvia's deciding she wants a \"real man\", one who has gumption. She begins to take interest in Ra\u00fal. Conchita does not approve of this relationship either because she wants Ra\u00fal for herself. Silvia, in the meantime, starts responding to Ra\u00fal's advances. This enrages Jos\u00e9 Luis, who rapes Silvia and swears to kill Ra\u00fal. The film ends with a fight to the death between Jos\u00e9 and Ra\u00fal. Jos\u00e9 Luis catches Ra\u00fal having sex with Conchita and engages in duel with legs of ham for weapons. Jos\u00e9 Luis is eventually killed by Ra\u00fal. Just as the couple grieve over Jos\u00e9 Luis, Silvia and Jos\u00e9 Luis's father arrive, followed by Silvia's mother. The films ends with a peculiar grieving scene, which reiterates the recurring themes of primal instincts, infidelity and destruction.\n"}
