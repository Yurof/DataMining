One day she meets her old enemy, Monsieur, brother of the king, accompanied by his noblemen. A tragedy occurs, \"Le masque rouge\" burns to the ground and Ang\u00e9lique swears revenge. She calls on her friend Claude le Petit aka \"Le po\u00e8te crott\u00e9\". He writes pamphlets in which they accuse the noblemen surrounding Monsieur. The king disapproves what his brother did but he doesn't like what Ang\u00e9lique is doing. He sends his best policeman to her, the former lawyer of Jeoffrey, Desgrez. He promises her a license to make and sell chocolate and 50.000 livres as compensation for the loss of \"Le masque rouge\", on the condition that she stops publishing the pamphlets and Monsieur's name isn't mentioned. In her new establishment she then encounters her cousin Philippe de Plessis-Belli\u00e8res. They have a passionate affair, but Ang\u00e9lique wants him to marry her so she blackmails him with an old secret. Eventually Philippe asks her to be his wife and he introduces her to the court.\n"}
