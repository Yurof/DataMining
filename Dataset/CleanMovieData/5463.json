{"wikiId": "11217044", "titre": "Fantaghir\u00f2", "dateSortie": "1991", "duree": "", "genre": ["Family Film", "Adventure"], "resume": "The story is about Fantaghir\u00f2, the rebellious youngest daughter of a warrior king. Although the women in the kingdom are expected to be submissive and servile, Fantaghir\u00f2 wants to fight in battle. She constantly argues with her father and two sisters Catherine and Caroline who disapprove of her behaviour. Fantaghir\u00f2 secretly learns to fight when she befriends the White Knight, a mysterious warrior whom she meets in the forest. As they are training, she briefly crosses paths with King Romualdo, the ruler of a neighbouring enemy kingdom. Romualdo is enchanted by Fantaghir\u00f2's eyes, but is unaware that they belong to the daughter of his sworn enemy. Romualdo, who is tired of the centuries-old war between the two kingdoms, sends an offer of a single duel to determine the outcome of the war. Fantaghir\u00f2's father, the King, is told by the magical White Witch that only one of his daughters can win the duel. Seeing no other option, the King commands Fantaghir\u00f2 and her two sisters Catherine and Caroline to dress up as knights so that one may fight Romualdo. They agree to keep the identity of the three \"knights\" secret, in case Romualdo would refuse to fight a woman. While Caterina and Carolina complain about the hot and heavy armour, Fantaghir\u00f2 relishes the opportunity and cuts her hair to make her look like a boy. As they are travelling to Romualdo's kingdom, the three sisters get into another argument. Fantaghir\u00f2 eventually apologises, but Catherine and Caroline decide that their youngest sister is the most qualified to win the duel. Catherine and Caroline return to their father and Fantaghir\u00f2 continues on her journey. Fantaghir\u00f2 eventually meets with Romualdo, who is confused when he recognises her eyes. After various attempts by Romualdo to discover her true gender by trickery, they eventually battle and Fantaghir\u00f2 emerges victorious. However, she cannot kill him and returns home in shame. Fantaghir\u00f2's father, who is proud of what his daughter has achieved, forgives her. The King also allows Romualdo to continue to rule his people, on the condition that he marry one of the three princesses. Although at first Romualdo is hesitant to agree, when he sees Fantaghir\u00f2 dressed up as a woman, the two kiss happily.\n"}
