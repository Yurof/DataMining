{"wikiId": "2571942", "titre": "Surviving Picasso", "dateSortie": "1996-09-04", "duree": "125.0", "genre": ["Romantic drama", "Biographical film", "Drama", "Romance Film", "Biopic [feature]"], "resume": "The film starts with a young woman named Fran\u00e7oise meeting Picasso in Paris during the Nazi occupation of the city, where Picasso is complaining that people broke into his house and stole his linen, rather than his paintings. It shows Fran\u00e7oise being beaten by her father after telling him she wants to be a painter, rather than a lawyer. Picasso is shown as often not caring about other people's feelings, firing his driver after a long period of service, and as a womanizer, saying that he can sleep with whomever he wants. The film is seen through the eyes of his lover Fran\u00e7oise Gilot . As the producers were unable to get permission, to show the works of Picasso in the film, the film is more about Picasso's personal life rather than his works, and where it does show paintings, they are not of his more famous works. When Picasso is shown painting Guernica, the camera sits high above the painting, with the work only slightly visible. The film depicts several of the women who were important in Picasso's life, such as Olga Khokhlova , Dora Maar , Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter , and Jacqueline Roque .\n"}
