{"wikiId": "14289279", "titre": "The Love of a Man", "dateSortie": "1997", "duree": "88.0", "genre": ["LGBT", "Romantic comedy", "Sex comedy", "World cinema", "Drama", "Comedy"], "resume": "Ram\u00f3n is a sexually active gay man with men coming and going from his bedroom. His best friend Esperanza is a single woman who can't seem to meet or like any men unless they are gay. Some would call Esperanza a fag hag, but she simply has great taste in men, she likes them gay! They go out together to the bars and Ramon always brings a man home while Esperanza goes home to an empty bed. She doesn't mind because she knows that she has Ram\u00f3n's heart. That is until Ram\u00f3n meets her fellow teacher, Roberto. Their relationship endangers the precious bond these two have formed. This colorful and somewhat hyper-active film is in the style of Almod\u00f3var. There's always plenty of on-screen action, dialogue and color to keep the eyes and ears happy. It's a tender and intimate peek into the lives of two people that one seldom sees on screen. It seems as if Madrid is teeming with gorgeous gay men, after seeing Amor de Hombre it should be a stop in every gay man's life.\n"}
