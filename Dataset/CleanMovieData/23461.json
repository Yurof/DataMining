At a roadside barricade heading into the serious Baja outback, they are inspected by police but aren\u2019t told about a deranged killer who has escaped from prison and is at large in the area. Upon arrival at the secret fishing spot, young Bobby goes exploring out onto a rotting pier. He can\u2019t work his way back, and when Dad attempts to come to his son\u2019s rescue, the pier gives way. Dad isn\u2019t hurt, but a piling falls on his leg and traps him on the beach just as the tide is coming in. The Stilwins quickly determine that if Pop isn\u2019t freed within a few hours, he will drown in the rising surf. All attempts to move the log are futile and wife Helen takes the car to get help. However, an escaped criminal kidnaps her. Can the woman get back to her husband before he drowns in the surf?\n"}
