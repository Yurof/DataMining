He is known to have a previous job but the movie doesn't expand on that. He eats and sleeps underground and never sees the sunlight. He is a member of a ticket inspector team . His team struggles to check riders' tickets because people revile and hate them to the point where ticket inspectors are assaulted daily. When not on duty late at night, Bulcs\u00fa explores the abandoned or under-construction sections of the subway tunnels. Among the ticket inspectors on the same shift there is a conflict between Bulcs\u00fa's team and another team. Bulcs\u00fa is challenged to \"rail running\" by this other team's leader. \"Rail running\" is an event similar to the running of the bulls. Once the last passenger train leaves the station, the contenders must run through the tunnels and exit before the last 'express' train, which does not stop at any station. Bulcs\u00fa exits the tunnel first with his opponent close behind. Bulcs\u00fa pulls the opponent off the track just in time to prevent the train running over him. While Bulcs\u00fa is on a ticket inspection, he meets a woman, Sofie , who is dressed as a bear and never buys a ticket for the metro. No direct explanation is ever given as to why she is dressed as a bear, however, it is implied that the costume is part of her job. Bulcs\u00fa falls in love with Sofie, and much later he discovers that she is the daughter of his good friend B\u00e9la , a metro driver . B\u00e9la is an alcoholic; he used to drive trains on the surface until he crashed a train due to \"lack of braking distance\". Deaths start occurring in the Metro  with passengers and bystanders seemingly leaping into the path of the oncoming trains. At first the characters think the victims are suicidal jumpers. The audience, however, and later Bulcs\u00fa see that the deaths are caused by someone, or something, pushing each victim onto the tracks right before a train comes. The identity of the murderer is never known and is seen only as a quickly moving hooded figure. The figure is wearing the same kind of leather jacket and hoodie that Bulcs\u00fa is seen dressed in throughout the film; further obscuring the murderers identity. When Bulcs\u00fa is chasing a troublesome passenger, nicknamed \"Bootsie\" , the murderer pushes Bootsie in front of a train. Bulcs\u00fa is suspected of the crime, which leads to him quitting his job. While brooding and in despair he is attacked by the murderer. He has to run for his life on the rails. In the end, the train apparently hits the murderer, and Bulcs\u00fa leaves the underground hand in hand with Sofie. Every staircase of the escalator is moving upwards.\n"}
