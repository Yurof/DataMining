M\u00f9i is notably peaceful and curious about the world. The family consists of a frequently absent husband, a wife, an older son, two younger sons, and the husband's mother. When the husband leaves for his fourth and final time, he takes all the household's money. He returns ill and passes away shortly after. Ten years later, the family falls on hard times. Two sons have left and the wife has taken the place of the grandmother upstairs, rarely seen and tragic. Although the wife now realizes she considered M\u00f9i one of her own, M\u00f9i changes homes. She becomes a servant for a pianist who was a friend of the older son when they were younger. That man is engaged to be married, but he prefers playing the piano to spending time with his fiance. One night, as the man's fiance chatters on, his piano playing becomes more and more stormy as he ignores her. When she leaves she watches through the window. As M\u00f9i comes into the room, his music becomes more harmonious. Later that night, the pianist goes to M\u00f9i's quarters after dark and closes the door behind him. When the fiance learns of this, the engagement is broken. The pianist starts teaching M\u00f9i to read and write as well as comport herself as a lady. A pregnant M\u00f9i reads poetry to her husband, her unborn child, and the wife of her original household.\n"}
