The trips are frequent and long, and they have to stop often, as Matt gets sick. Sarah and her husband Peter , a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sarah finds a man putting up a \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign in front of a large house. The man offers to sell her the house, noting that it has a bit of history, as it was formerly a funeral home. On the trip home, Matt is in extreme pain, so Sarah drives back to the house, where they stay for the night. Matt sees his reflection become distorted, and sees a figure in the reflection of his T.V. The following day, Peter arrives with Matt\u2019s brother Billy  and cousins Wendy  and Mary , and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, which also has a mysterious door, later discovered to lead to the old morgue room. After moving into the house, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. He also sees strange creatures and appears to his family to be having blackouts. At the hospital, Matt confesses that he\u2019s been seeing things to another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu . Nicholas tells Matt to call him if he needs to talk. After another vision, Matt calls Nicholas and tells him about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room. He asks the spirit what it wants from him and the ghost begins to move towards him. When the rest of the family comes home, they find that all of the furniture has been stacked in the middle of the front room and Matt shirtless with his fingers bloody from scratching at the wall. The family begins to crack under the stress of Matt\u2019s illness and bizarre behavior. Meanwhile, the children find a metal box of photographs, which show Jonah, a young man from Matt\u2019s visions, at a s\u00e9ance, emitting ectoplasm. Wendy suggests the house may be haunted and she and Matt research its history. They find out that the funeral home was run by a man named Aickman, the sinister bearded man from Matt\u2019s visions. Aickman also conducted psychic research and would host s\u00e9ances with Jonah as the medium. At one s\u00e9ance, all those attending, including Aickman, were found dead and Jonah disappeared. Later in the 1950s, the state was building a new road that would run through part of the cemetery near the house, and when the coffins were exhumed, it was discovered that many of the bodies had disappeared and were never buried. Matt and Wendy then contact Nicholas to seek his help. Nicholas finds a smaller box containing eyelids that Aickman cut off of the corpses, and theorizes that Aickman was practicing necromancy in an attempt to control the dead and bind them to the house. He realizes that Aickman did this in an attempt to magnify Jonah\u2019s medium abilities. He asks Matt and Wendy to take his hands and pray with him for the souls of the missing bodies and for Jonah. When Matt takes their hands, he is drawn into a vision of that final s\u00e9ance. He watches as Jonah begins to painfully emit the ectoplasm from his mouth. He is broken from the vision when Sarah comes home. That night, both Wendy and Sarah suffer visions of spirits. Peter arrives in a drunken state, and begins shouting at everyone for having the lights on, causing a frightening racket. Sarah confronts him shortly after, and warns him not to come home if he drinks again. When the family goes to sleep, all of the electronics in the house go haywire, terrifying them. In desperation, Sarah contacts Nicholas. Nicholas finds human remains in the house and removes them, after which the activity stops. Matt later awakens to find Aikman\u2019s symbols carved into his flesh. He is taken to the hospital, where he encounters Jonah. Meanwhile, Nicholas nearly crashes his car when Jonah appears in his backseat. He and Matt begin to have simultaneous visions, in which Jonah is shown years before. After emitting the ectoplasm, Jonah\u2019s entire family is burnt to a degree, after a flash of bright light. After angering a demonic presence, Jonah flees, only to have the spirit affect everything in the home. Seemingly the only way out, Jonah uses a dumbwaiter to escape, calling for help. Entering an unknown chamber, Jonah realizes that he has entered the home furnace. Quickly before escaping, the spirit traps Jonah in the furnace, and burns him alive, unknown to his father. Matt and Nicholas then break from the vision, after which Jonah\u2019s spirit disappears. Peter and Sarah meet at the hospital and learn that Matt\u2019s cancer treatments have had no effect. They then discover that Matt has escaped the hospital. Back at the house, Wendy discovers all the food in the house has suddenly turned rotten. She takes a shower, while Nicholas leaves a message telling the family to get out of the house immediately \u2013 Jonah\u2019s spirit was actually protecting them from the spirits. Wendy is nearly suffocated by the shower curtain, but escapes, only to see Matt arrive with an axe. Matt breaks through the walls in the front room with the axe, revealing the dusty corpses Aickman hid in the walls. He forces Wendy and the children out of the house, barricading himself inside and tearing down the other walls, as marked corpses begin to tumble into the room. As he swings the axe, the view switches from Matt to Jonah, who seems to be occupying Matt\u2019s body. Matt lights the bodies and the room on fire, then crouches in pain in the middle of the room, as the bound spirits surround him. Sarah, Peter and Nicholas arrive with the fire department, Sarah and Peter frantically trying to get in to save Matt. Sarah gets into the house and takes Matt under a table to avoid the falling timbers. The spirits finally disappear, seemingly freed, as a firefighter breaks through and pulls Matt and Sarah to safety. Outside, everyone watches tearfully as the emergency crew attempts to resuscitate a dying Matt. As Matt slips away, he has a vision of himself standing in the graveyard where he sees Jonah, no longer appearing burnt. He seems about to follow Jonah when he hears his mother\u2019s voice. He returns to his body and Jonah\u2019s spirit leaves him, appearing next to Nicholas before finally vanishing, as he can now move on. At the end of the film, we are told that Matt\u2019s cancer has disappeared, and the house was rebuilt and resold with no further reported incidents of haunting.\n"}
