The man claims he is God, but Taoca doesn't believe him until he performs some miracles. It seems God has decided to take a break and is searching for someone to temporarily take over. With Taoca, God travels the country in hopes of finding a new saint who is fit for the job. Along the way, they meet a woman, Mad\u00e1, who joins the two in hopes they will take her to S\u00e3o Paulo, where her mother has died. Eventually, the trio comes across a young man who appears to have the right qualifications, except he has no belief in a higher power.\n"}
