Twenty-year-old Fran\u00e7ois  is in love with the fiercely independent 25-year-old Anne . One morning, Anne's airline-pilot ex, Christian , visits her to tell her that it is over between them and that he will return to his wife. Fran\u00e7ois just happens to see the two leave Anne's building together and becomes obsessed by the idea that she is cheating on him. As he strolls aimlessly through the streets of Paris, he catches sight of Christian in a caf\u00e9 with another woman. As they leave and jump on a bus Fran\u00e7ois decides to follow them. A 15-year-old girl he has never met, Lucie  figures out what he is up to and playfully joins in with his amateur espionage. Throughout the day, their stories and explanations for Christian's action become increasingly complex and outlandish. Eventually, they lose track of Christian in a taxi and they both leave, promising to write to each other if they ever found out what Christian was really up to. Fran\u00e7ois returns to Anne where he discovers that all was not as it seemed between Christian and the blonde woman. Later that night Fran\u00e7ois goes to Lucie's flat seemingly to put a postcard in her mail box. He spots Lucie embracing a young man, obviously returning from a date. He leaves, although stopping to drop the postcard into a mailbox.\n"}
