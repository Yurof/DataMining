On 21 March 1943, Rudolf Christoph von Gersdorff intends a suicide bombing attack on Hitler in an exhibition, yet Hitler leaves prematurely. A similar attempt by Axel von dem Bussche fails as the event is canceled due to allied air raid on Berlin. Last hope is on Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg who, being in charge of Operation Walk\u00fcre, has access to Hitler for reports. The bomb detonates on 20 July 1944 in Rastenburg. After returning to Berlin, he orchestrates the July 20 plot which fails after rumors, reports and finally confirmation about Hitler's survival become known. Four officers are executed immediately, many more after staged Volksgerichtshof trials.\n"}
