Among them is Helen McNulty , a journalist tortured by the death squads of an unidentified Central American country controlled by a dictatorship. In time she grows close to Ram\u00edrez, but suspicions are aroused when three men attempt to detain him while he and McNulty are on a date. McNulty is able to photograph one of the assailants and sends the picture to a colleague for possible identification. During one of the Scotch-fueled late night conversations between McNulty and Ram\u00edrez, he talks about a childhood friend who was an officer in the Army of his home country. Ram\u00edrez portrays his friend as a man who followed orders without questioning the morality of them, preferring to go along with his superiors in order to protect his family. Eventually McNulty's colleague contacts the person in the picture and arranges a meeting where the man and his two associates identify themselves as police from Ramirez's home country. They inform McNulty that Ram\u00edrez is a fugitive and wanted for torture. Back at group therapy session in the clinic, McNulty violently confronts Ram\u00edrez with this revelation, where he confesses that the childhood friend he spoke of was really himself. When asked why he came to the clinic, Ram\u00edrez stated that he wanted \"to feel human again.\" Dr. Lenke and the patients escort Ram\u00edrez out of the clinic, where the police take him into custody.\n"}
