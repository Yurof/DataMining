{"wikiId": "17640203", "titre": "Venussian tabutasco", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "60.0", "genre": ["Indie"], "resume": "The stories of the people living in this building are told as camera tilts constantly up and down the 5 story building while we see the actions through the glass elevator of the building. The scenes are homages from Tati, to Buster Keaton, Hitchcock, to Bu\u00f1uel, and finally ends with Tarantino's suitcase effect. There is a Gangster story on the fifth floor, in which a thief has stolen a suitcase from the gangsters who now know where he lives. The thief's girlfriend falls in love with the boy in the third floor who is actually an undecided homosexual who in turn falls in love with the man on the second floor, and together they beat up the boxer who helps the gangsters on the first floor. Eventually their lives interrelate to one another as they are seen appearing and disappearing in and out of the elevator. As the film continues, new stories unfold connecting the lives of the residents further and more hilariously to one another.\n"}
