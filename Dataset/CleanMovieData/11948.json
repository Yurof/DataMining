{"wikiId": "9504064", "titre": "El Boquete", "dateSortie": "2006-03-10", "duree": "83.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Comedy"], "resume": "When paterfamilias Escarfase  is released from prison, he's immediately roped into a caper designed by thick-headed Ruben , using a seemingly abandoned house as the command center for tunneling into the neighboring bank vault. Also on board are Escarfase's hooker daughter Mirna , whose participation in a porn film takes up an indefensible amount of screen time considering the minuscule laugh pay-off. The opening promises more than it can deliver, but like the rest of pic, scenes start well and devolve into wasted footage. Bouncy music is used indiscriminately and, like the overly sunny lensing, gets tired quickly.\n"}
