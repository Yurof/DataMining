{"wikiId": "28225154", "titre": "Northern Comfort", "dateSortie": "2010", "duree": "75.0", "genre": ["Drama"], "resume": "The film tells the story of Horace  and Cassandra  who meet while traveling to Canada. The pair skirt around their feelings as Gerwig deals with an illness which she's keeping to herself. \"Because they\u2019re damaged in similar ways \u2014 we learn they\u2019re both the black sheep of their respective families \u2014 they make for sweet-and-sour traveling companions, or would if Cassandra didn\u2019t keep disappearing on Horace. The people they meet on the road offer varying object lessons in coping with the disaster of living. A comically mismatched couple at a roadside motel  seem ready to seduce our heroes or at least drag them into a discussion of superheroes as modern gods. A hermit  offers Horace and Cassandra beds for the night, a musical interlude, and a glimpse of one man\u2019s sad isolation. The closest the movie gets to a statement comes from an older man in a diner  who locates nirvana in the act of tying flies.\" <ref name'Northern Comfort' movie review - 'Northern Comfort' showtimes|authorMay 28, 2010|workOctober 18, 2010}}\n"}
