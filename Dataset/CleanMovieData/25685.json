Cl\u00e9lia's mother once dated MacRoi years ago while working as a caberet singer. Once she became pregnant with Cl\u00e9lia, she stopped seeing MacRoi and married Cl\u00e9lia's father. Accompanying her daughter to Paris, she tells Cl\u00e9lia that her strongest principle was honour, and encourages her to get married and settle down. In Paris Cl\u00e9lia gives a television interview and talks about her two successful books of photography: a \"study of absence\" showing empty streets and deserted landscapes, and a study of fashion models without showing their faces. While walking the Paris streets taking photographs, Cl\u00e9lia meets Cl\u00e8ve , a bumbling middle-aged children's book publisher who is preparing to marry MacRoi's wealthy daughter to bolster his flagging publishing house. Cl\u00e8ve is immediately attracted to Cl\u00e9lia and invites her back to his office where they make love. Afterwards, she meets Cl\u00e8ve's brother Bernard, a Catholic bishop, and their father. At the La Verite offices, Cl\u00e9lia finds most of her co-workers to be disillusioned and perverse\u2014all knowing that they \"earn their keep on dirt.\" At her first assignment covering a hockey team that MacRoi recently purchased, Cl\u00e9lia finds herself in the team's locker room surrounded by naked players celebrating their victory. MacRoi is there and after teasing her about her taking photos of the naked players asks if she'll join his family for a dinner party. Before she leaves, Cl\u00e9lia has sex with one of the players. At MacRoi's dinner party, Cl\u00e8ve loudly declares his love for Cl\u00e9lia before his entire family, including his fiance, Geni\u00e8vre MacRoi, the sister of Rupert MacRoi. Geni\u00e8vre responds by calling off their wedding and hitting him. Later that evening, following MacRoi's announcement of the purchase of Cl\u00e8ve's publishing company, Cl\u00e8ve's father collapses and dies while his son and Cl\u00e9lia look on. Cl\u00e8ve asks Cl\u00e9lia never to leave him. At the funeral, Cl\u00e8ve confides in Cl\u00e9lia his fears that MacRoi will not respect his family's publishing house now that he owns it, saying, \"He massacres all that is upright and inneficient, delicate and noble.\" Soon after, Cl\u00e9lia and her mother move into Cl\u00e8ve's house. He gives her his mother's engagement ring. In bed she reads lines from a W. H. Auden poem, \"This like a dream keeps other time, and daytime is the loss of this, for time is inches and the heart's changes, where ghost has haunted lost and wanted. But this was never a ghost's endeavor, nor finished this, was ghost at ease, and till it pass love shall not near the sweetness here nor sorrow take his endless look.\" Cl\u00e9lia's first portfolio of photos for La Verite creates a sensation and she is congratulated by her colleagues\u2014all except N\u00e9mo , a sexy young photographer who promptly propositions her upon their first encounter. In spite of her sexual attraction to N\u00e9mo, Cl\u00e9lia marries Cl\u00e8ve in a ceremony marred somewhat by the presence of La Verite photographers and reporters, including N\u00e9mo. After the wedding, N\u00e9mo leaves his girlfriend, Ina , a former African princess and Parisian prostitute whom he met investigating the illegal organ trade. He delivers his wedding photos to Cl\u00e9lia's home, handing them to her mother. Upset at the intrusion, and suspecting her daughter is having an affair, Cl\u00e9lia's mother collapses and soon dies. N\u00e9mo continues to follow Cl\u00e9lia, even taking photos of her in her house making love to her husband. Later she learns that N\u00e9mo was given this assignment by MacRoi who is looking to find dirt on Cl\u00e8ve. Although she continues to see N\u00e9mo, Cl\u00e9lia resolutely keeps to her wedding vows in the face of her suitor's continued advances. She travels by train to Normandy to attend a motorcycle event in which N\u00e9mo is a participant. During the race N\u00e9mo crashes, and Cl\u00e9lia rushes to his side, revealing her feelings for him. At the celebration afterwards, N\u00e9mo gets drunk and loud, talking about his investigation into the illegal organ trade and the shady International characters involved. Later that night he and Cl\u00e9lia take the train back to Paris together. After N\u00e9mo is attacked by a gang hired by the illegal organ traffickers, Cl\u00e9lia asks him to show her the world he is investigating\u2014a dark world of brutal human fighting to the death. Throughout their time together, N\u00e9mo continues his advances toward her, but Cl\u00e9lia resists. When she returns to her home, Cl\u00e8ve is convinced she is having an affair, despite her promises that she's never lied to him and will never be unfaithful to him. After learning that his brother the bishop has run off with a married woman, Cl\u00e8ve says he will join his brother in Plougastel-Daoulas in Brittany at The Happy Inn. After they make love Cl\u00e8ve writes on the bathroom mirror, \"Oh but what worm am I the victim of that you then unabashed did what I never wished confessed another love and I submissive, felt unwanted and went out?\" After he leaves, Cl\u00e9lia calls the offices of La Verite to inform them of Bishop Bernard's \"love-nest\" in Brittany, and soon the scandal erupts in the news. Cl\u00e9lia watches the television coverage of his public humiliation. Cl\u00e8ve does not return to his wife, and after sleeping with a transvestite prostitute, he calls La Verite asking that they track his wife who he believes is two-timing him. Meanwhile, Cl\u00e9lia comes to N\u00e9mo's house, where assassins hired by the organ traffickers blast the place with gunfire, but N\u00e9mo and Cl\u00e9lia are able to defend themselves and escape. Soon after, Cl\u00e9lia attends a publicity session with MacRoi and a new partner. MacRoi presents N\u00e9mo with a new expensive motorcycle for his work covering Cl\u00e9lia. During the session, assassins again attempt to kill N\u00e9mo, and during the attack both N\u00e9mo and Cl\u00e8ve are injured. MacRoi is killed by a shard of glass in his eye. After the funeral, MacRoi's daughter reorganizes the company, intending to continue the scandal-mongering. She also fires Cl\u00e9lia, who later begs her husband to come back to her, but he will not reconsider. On their way out of the building he falls down a flight of steps and dies on the way to the hospital, with Cl\u00e9lia at his side. At the funeral she avoids N\u00e9mo's advances and leaves Paris. Sometime later, N\u00e9mo is interviewed on television and talks about his new portfolio dedicated to Cl\u00e9lia, who has disappeared. A few years later, while taking photographs in a monastery, Cl\u00e9lia by chance sees the beginning of an English-language MacRoi Production film called The Princess of Cleve about her life, directed by N\u00e9mo. She laughs at the absurdity. Before leaving the monastery, she places her wedding rings on a tree branch, while the ghost of her late husband looks on. Cl\u00e9lia can only say, \"Forgive me.\" He smiles and retrieves the rings while she weeps.\n"}
