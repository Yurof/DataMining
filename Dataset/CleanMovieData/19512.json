{"wikiId": "3198839", "titre": "French Rarebit", "dateSortie": "1951", "duree": "", "genre": ["Short Film", "Family Film", "Comedy", "Animation"], "resume": "In Paris, France, a delivery truck carrying a crate marked \"Carrots from U.S.A.\" accidentally loses the crate, along with Bugs Bunny, after driving on a bumpy road. As Bugs is trying to figure out where he is, he looks at the Rue de la Paix, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and the Eiffel Tower, he realizes where he is, and decides to \"stroll down this boulevard and look over the monsewers and mademoysels\" where two French chefs, Louis and Fran\u00e7ois, both want to cook dinner specials for their restaurants, and both their dishes involve rabbits. They both spot Bugs and, after secretly measuring him while Bugs is not looking, attempt to catch him. But Bugs is already on to them, and is not caught. He asks Fran\u00e7ois what he has in the tureen, to which Fran\u00e7ois says he has a rabbit. Bugs asks if he could see the \"rabbit\" and Fran\u00e7ois agrees, but after that, Bugs comments, \"Hmm...sort of a short-eared critter, ain't he, doc?\" That makes Fran\u00e7ois realize in shock that he has entrapped Louis instead of Bugs and accuses Louis of stealing his rabbit, to which Louis replies that the rabbit is his, to which Fran\u00e7ois points out that the rabbit is his and NOT Louis. That gives Bugs the perfect idea to trick the two chefs into fighting over who gets to cook him, to which Bugs whispers to the audience, \"What a revolting display of temper,\" until Fran\u00e7ois comes out on top. Bugs tricks Fran\u00e7ois into believing he has a recipe for \"a good old Louisiana Back-bay Bayou Bunny Bordelaise, a la Antoine\" from the famed Antoine's of New Orleans. Fran\u00e7ois asks for the recipe, which Bugs refuses. But he decides to demonstrate it on him. So he disguises Fran\u00e7ois as a rabbit, pickles him, and stuffs him full of every spicy ingredient in the kitchen before placing him in a bowl of vegetables. Louis comes in and demands that Bugs, who Louis obviously mistakes to be Fran\u00e7ois, that he get the rabbit back until Fran\u00e7ois whacks him on the head with a mallet, making Louis see that Fran\u00e7ois, who asks if he was expecting Humphrey Bogart, is the rabbit. Louis asks, \"MONSIEUR FRAN\u00c7OIS, WHAT HAPPENED?!\" To this, Fran\u00e7ois tells him that Bugs knows the recipe from the famed Antoine, forcing Louis to demand that Bugs now show him the recipe. Bugs agrees and does the same routine to him then places them into an oven  with a carrot, which also has a stick of dynamite in it. After the dynamite explodes, the two goofy chefs, having survived the blast, jauntily sing Alouette, adding, with a cheer, \"Vive Antoine!\" To this, Bugs remarks as the cartoon closes, \"Poi-sonally, I prefer hamboigah.\"\n"}
