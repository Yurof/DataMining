{"wikiId": "17233268", "titre": "LSD 25", "dateSortie": "2000-02-10", "duree": "13.0", "genre": ["Short Film", "Documentary"], "resume": "Through audio interviews and montage sequences, LSD 25 is the travelogue of a young Nova Scotian woman's trip to Montreal in 1995, and the pyschotronic meltdown which she underwent there. Stephanie Preyde herself eloquently and unflinchingly narrates the film, describing the cumulative effects of the copious amounts of acid she took during that summer, the ongoing and Byzantine delusions which she suffered , the repudiation of her physical self, her eventual institutilization and journey to \"normalcy.\" In this experimental documentary\u2014set to a trippy acid jazz score\u2014Preyde faces the ongoing repercussion of her trips: a possible misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder instead of temporary acid psychosis, and ironically, lifelong reliance on prescription meds.\n"}
