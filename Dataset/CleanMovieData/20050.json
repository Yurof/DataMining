He is arrested and sentenced to death but the judge recommends mercy and asks the Home Secretary for a reprieve. The Home Secretary at first refuses, but when he mistakenly comes to believe that his own wife is unfaithful, he releases how easy it would have been to kill her. After this, he grants a reprieve for Gannon and resolves to show his wife more affection.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900\u20131977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p45\n"}
