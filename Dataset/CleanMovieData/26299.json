{"wikiId": "9731626", "titre": "The Fox in the Chicken Coop", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "", "genre": ["Comedy film", "Satire"], "resume": "Amitz Dolniker, an aging Israeli Parliament member known for his high-winded babbling and tireless lecturing, is told he needs to take a break from politics after he collapses during a speech. Fainting, he starts out on a dream trip to spend some weeks in a far-away, backward Israeli village that has little contact with civilization. The farmers\u2019 bucolic and carefree life repels him at first , but then he decides to introduce some \u201corder\u201d to the innocent society. As none of the villagers agree to become the village head , Dolniker hires a local horse and buggy and puts it at the service of the village barber, declaring him village head \u201cde facto\u201d. The barber objects at first, but as he becomes used to the perks that come along with the position, his grip on power tightens. This leads to a rivalry with other villagers  who think themselves equally worthy of becoming the village head , which is what Dolniker has expected. He suggests an election to determine the leader. The result, however, bears no resemblance to the orderly political process he is used to, and Dolniker finds himself entangled in silly power struggles, taxes imposed on 3-door closets, corruption, petty bureaucracy, and a ruination of the simple way of life the village once knew. Dolniker comes back to his senses, mildly laughing about himself.\n"}
