Unlike others, he doesn\u2019t find any job big or small\u2026he just takes up anything that comes his way. The movie opens showing him delivering Newspapers at people\u2019s doors \u2013 but the job is not permanent. He likes painting and usually makes paintings that depict village life\u2026on being asked by his friend he says city life is very mechanical and he doesn\u2019t like it. When his Maa ji  sees one of his paintings she says that the house in his painting is so much like his dadaji\u2019s house. But alas, his father had to leave it and come to the city because of sarkari naukari. Saying that she leaves for post office to collect her husband\u2019s pension but he stops her. He goes to the Post Office instead. At the Post Office, Om Shivpuri is interviewing people for the post of a Post Man at Sitapur and gets so frustrated talking to people who come for the interview. When Ravi comes to collect his father\u2019s pension, he takes it for granted that he\u2019s one of the interview candidates and starts asking him questions. He asks Ravi for his age and Ravi says : As per certificates, it\u2019s 21 but that\u2019s not correct. Om: How can you say that? Ravi : Because no one knows which year I was born in\u2026Mom says there was a flood in the village the year I was born, as though I wouldn\u2019t have been born had it not been for the floods. She also says, I was born after 2 years since she got married and there was a drought that year. This part is very interesting. Ravi, unaware that he\u2019s being interviewed answers with such carefree attitude. And Om Shivpuri, on the other hand is also pleasantly surprised and enjoys the conversation. At the end of 5 minutes, Om Shivpuri offers him the job and Ravi gladly takes it up. Now that he\u2019s an official postman, he comes home in Postman\u2019s uniform and says : Postman\u2026.money order. His mom comes to the door, checks the sheet: Maa : Yeh kaisa moneyorder hai bhai?  Ravi : Bhai nahin maa, beta kaho beta!  Maa tu toh aise ghabra gayi\u2026daakiya bana, koi daaku thodi na bana\u2026aur phir sarkari naukari hai \u2013 rehne ke liye kapda makaan muft aur rotiyaan Manoj Kumar se maang lenge.  Maa : Woh kaun hai?  Ravi : Maa tu picturen nahin dekhti. His mother is worried that he\u2019s going for such a job when he\u2019s so well educated. But he is happy to be employed. So he sets out for Sitapur. After getting down from the train, he boards Nattu\u2019s  Tanga bound for Sitapur. Existing Post Master explains his job to him\u2026says his job would also include writing letters for others, reading out their letters etc. apart from just delivering them\u2026because not everybody in the village is literate. Ravi is asked to share his quarters with Raghu Rampuri, who\u2019s a unique-piece item. The moment Ravi enters the house Raghu says : The only two things that are famous from Rampur are \u2013 me and chaku.And then introduces him as a poet. When Ravi says that he\u2019s never heard his poems, Raghu says : it\u2019s just that I am ahead of my poems \u2013 I became more famous than my poems. Parcel  lives with Raghu. He cleans the house and cooks for him, in return Raghu teaches him how to read and write. Ravi : Kiska ladka hai?  Raghu : Daak khaane ka . He lives at the post office, noone knows who his parents are but he loves reading. Maybe he\u2019ll also become a Postman like you when he grows up.On his first day at work, he goes to the temple in the morning to deliver Panditji\u2019s letter and sees Mohini  there. There\u2019s an old lady in the village, whose son, Rasulla, had joined the Army and gone away\u2026 and who never returned back. She\u2019s gone insane waiting to hear from him. She sits guarding a mango tree from other kids in the village. She\u2019s been dying to hear from her son for years and when Ravi comes there and chases the little boys troubling her away, she sees the letters on the carrier of Ravi\u2019s cycle and takes them away saying all those are her son\u2019s letters. He has to coax her into giving those letters back to him. And then he pulls out a blank paper from the stack of letters and recites : Meri pyaari ammi\u2026.pretending to read the content from a letter. And at the end he asks her : Nani, what\u2019s your son\u2019s name? And after she says the name, he ends the letter saying : Tera beta Rasulla.Then he goes about delivering letters\u2026he goes to a house and knocks, Mohini opens the door and is delighted to see the Postman\u2026he hands over a letter - Ravi : I am new here, had I known this letter was for you, I would have given it at the temple itself. Mohini : You are new, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t ask you if there was any letter for me when I saw you in the temple. But the letter is not for her, somebody showed him the wrong house and she\u2019s very disappointed. She, however, guides him to the correct address, Choudhary\u2019s house. His daughter, Chhutki  opens the door and talks non-stop that her father is not home with lots of if-else conditions. Finally when she\u2019s done, he gives her the letter and leaves. Chhutki\u2019s wedding has been fixed and the letter is from her sasural, she\u2019s very excited to know what\u2019s written in it\u2026so she comes to call Mohini so that they both could go somewhere and read the letter. She takes permission from Mohini\u2019s maa  and they both leave with an excuse of fetching water from the well.She opens the letter, puts the envelope behind on a stone wall surrounding the well and starts reading the letter. But she can\u2019t read properly and can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s written in it\u2026she asks Mohini for help but she can\u2019t read either. She says she would have gone and joined the army if she knew how to read and write. When they see people coming towards them, she tries to collect the envelope and leave from there, but in a hurry, she misses it and the envelope goes flying down into the well. There\u2019s a beautiful song here \u2013 Allah megh de. The letter finally reaches the Chaudhary and he reads it but is perplexed thinking how the Daakiya could have brought the letter without an envelope, which means no address. Chhutki lies to him saying that the letter was delivered without the envelope. And as though her saying so would help she says : Good that the kept the envelope. Imagine if he had to keep the letter and just give the envelope to us. We would never get to know what\u2019s in the letter. When Daakiya comes the following morning, Chaudhary is still perplexed wondering about the missing envelope and he asks him if he has come to distribute just the envelopes today. Now, it\u2019s Ravi\u2019s turn to get confused. He\u2019s accused of taking the envelope away.  Finally Mohini comes to his rescues and spills the truth to Chaudhary. Next, he goes searching for Aarti Sharma to give Money order\u2026.when he reaches her house, he sees her busy making quilts. She stops her work to chat with him for a while and says that it\u2019s her husband\u2019s pension. Aazadi ke jung mein saheed hue the - She claims to be an army\u2019s widow and yet she puts sindoor. He\u2019s kind of confused. And finding his puzzled expression very natural, she goes on to explain that she\u2019s Amar suhagan and all the others in the village call her Suhagi didi. She says she waits for this day not because she would get money but for her husband\u2026she feels connected to him in some way and when she puts sindoor she feels that he\u2019s still somewhere around. Ravi takes her hand, and takes her thumb impression on the paper before giving her the Pension amount. But she doesn\u2019t keep the money\u2026she sends it for the welfare of other armies who are fighting day and night, protecting the country and ensuring everybody\u2019s safety. At the end he realizes that she\u2019s educated and can converse fluently in English as well. He leaves feeling embarrassed for taking her thumb impression instead of asking her to sign. Ravi sits under a Peepal tree in front of Mohini\u2019s house and sorts his letters. And she awaits a letter herself quite desperately so keeps asking him if there\u2019s a letter for her. Ravi replies to her and continues with his work. Mohini  : Do you want some water? Ravi  : Yes, a glass of water, please. Mohini : What will a glass of water do, I will have to get a bucket full of water for you. And then she asks him if he would want some water\u2026to this he replies - Ravi : Yes, but not in a bucket. She goes towards the house and then stops half way through to ask if buttermilk would do. He nods. And she comes with a glass of buttermilk for him. Mohini : if I get any letters, do give it to me. Ravi : Who else would I give it to? Mohini: Oh I mean, don't give it to Maa. Ravi : Once bitten twice shy, I would never make that mistake again. I have learnt a lot from Chaudhary saab\u2019s letter episode . She behaves pretty mysterious asking about letters so he asks her if she gets letters often. Mohini : No, but just in case if I get any letters. Ravi : You wait so much for them, you must have got them earlier too. Mohini : No, not yet, but\u2026 Ravi : Who is it that you expect to hear from so much? Mohini :  I am supposed to get a letter form my Mamaji. And goes away saying she has to give buttermilk to her cow. Ravi : Buttermilk? To cow? Mohini : I mean water\u2026don\u2019t know what I am saying today Ravi  : You get so confused, has it ever happened that you kept your food plate in front of the cow and started eating the grass yourself? She laughs and goes away. Ravi sings Daakiya daak laaya as he goes about his work. He comes home from work very hungry and asks Parcel for food. Raghu gives him water and starts asking about Mohini. The entire village is talking about the two of them now. Ravi confides that he likes Mohini but has no idea how she feels for him. Just then Parcel comes with a sheet of paper and asks Raghu if it\u2019s ok\u2026Raghu after going through it approves of it and asks Parcel to post it. Ravi is confused as to what they both are up to. Raghu explains to him that nobody ever wrote him a letter in his life, so he\u2019s making Parcel write one and post it. He would reply to it on receiving it. One day on his way back home, Ravi sees Mohini sitting on a tree branch and staring.He asks her what she\u2019s looking at and she says she was thinking about the armies who were there few months ago for training. She would sit there and look at them for hours together. Mohini : This area used to be so full of armies some time back and now\u2026 Ravi : And now, let\u2019s both go and do a parade. Mohini : Who will distribute your letters then? Ravi : We could ask anybody to do that\u2026what\u2019s the name of that liar friend of yours? Chhutki? Let her go around giving the letters and her father will go behind her with the envelopes She asks him why he didn\u2019t come and sit under the Peepal tree today to sort his letters and mentions she was actually waiting for him the whole day. Ravi : You were waiting for me? or for your mamaji\u2019s letter? Mohini : Had made daliya today, you come everyday so had kept some for you too. Ravi : Is it still there or did you give it to your cow? Mohini : I have kept some for you. Ravi : Ok then, I have to go to Suhagi didi\u2019s house now, I\u2019ll come over after that . Suhagi has made some quilts and blankets and she gives them to Ravi to send them across to some regiment. Ravi comes to Mohini\u2019s place to have daliya. He barely sits down when Mohini\u2019s cow breaks free and runs away with the rope entangled with Ravi\u2019s cycle. Mohini\u2019s cow running away with Ravi\u2019s cycle \u2013 this becomes such a big breaking news and the hottest gossip in the village. Ravi goes behind the cow and finally brings both the cow and cycle home. But he gets hurt in the process. So Mohini tends to his wounds. She notices Suhagi\u2019s parcel and asks Ravi about it. Him : She has sent it for the armies. Her : What if I want to send a parcel to somebody? Him : You should have his name and regiment address and it will reach him. But\u2026why? You know any fauji? Her : No, I was just asking. Rekha makes a special appearance in this dance \u2013 Surme wale sainyaan hamaro ji. After a few days, she meets him by that tree again and takes his measurements for a sweater. He\u2019s very happy and is now sure that she likes him too. Another day she complains that he never brings a letter for her and then he promises to bring a letter for her the following day. He goes home that night and sits awake the whole night writing a letter to her \u2013 putting down his feelings on paper. When he meets her, he gives her the letter and she\u2019s extremely delighted. Then she shows him the sweater she has knit and asks him to try it. He\u2019s happily trying it out when she looks at the letter and says \u2013 now that he has written to me and I have his address, I can send the sweater too. He is shocked to find out that it\u2019s not for him. All his dreams are shattered and he\u2019s heart is broken\u2026 She then tells him her story \u2013 She had met Ravi , an army officer when his battalion was training near her village, fallen in love with him and had also quietly married him in a temple. But he had to go almost immediately after that and she has never heard of him since. However, she\u2019s sure he\u2019ll return back to her some day. Now that he knows she\u2019s already married, he decides to help her locate Ravi . Heartbroken as he is, he cannot help himself from singing a song \u2013 Ladkhadane do mujhe. He goes to the town the following morning searching for Ravi  but with no luck and finally comes back to Sitapur again. He meets Rasulla\u2019s mother at the station, she gives him a letter and asks him to read it. It has the news of Rasullah\u2019s death and the letter is dated ten years back. The very same day he receives a telegram saying that the Army Officer he was looking for has been killed in the war. With a heavy heart he goes to give the news to Mohini but there\u2019s a huge crowd gathered there. Mohini tells him that Rasulla\u2019s mother died of sorrow because somebody told her that her son is dead. Ravi feels guilty and tells her that he was the one who had read the letter out to her. At this she tells him he should have lied and hidden the truth from her. At least a lie would have saved her life. Everybody in the village knew of Rasulla\u2019s death but nobody had dared to break the news to her because they were scared she would die of shock. Now, Ravi  cannot bring himself to tell Mohini of Ravi\u2019s  death. And he goes back home with a heavier heart. He\u2019s in a dilemma as to whether to tell Mohini the truth or to hide it from her. Mohini, on the other hand, now aware that the war has come to an end starts waiting all the more eagerly for Ravi  \u2013 Ghungta gira hai. What will Ravi do now? Will he ever be able to tell Mohini the truth? Will she ever come to know that he was once in love with her? Will she misunderstand his intentions? Mohini\u2019s Maa is pressurizing her to get married\u2026how long will she be able to postpone it? Will she be able to voice out and explain about her marriage with Ravi ? Is Ravi  really dead? Or Ravi  has something else in mind?\n"}
