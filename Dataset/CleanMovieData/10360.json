Each is ambivalent about romantic feelings for the other and communicate through indirect means of hoping the other can read their mind, often followed by passive-aggressive tactics when such indirect communication inevitably leads to disappointment. Subplots concern Aimie's strained relationship with her mother, the absence of her father, and her increasing loneliness and isolation as she drifts apart from Tran.\n"}
