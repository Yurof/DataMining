In the second story arc, her stepbrother, and his domestic partner, Gil  are deciding whether or not to confront their friends, a lesbian couple , regarding the paternity of their son. And in the third, a young man, Otis,  is involved with a band and trying to keep his father, Frank (Tom Arnold , from learning that he is gay, while also dealing with the seemingly gold-digging woman, Jude , who inserts herself into their lives.\n"}
