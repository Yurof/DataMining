His brother Sim\u00f3n, head of the local guerrilla band, has forced the surrender of the Spanish guardia civil outpost and charged Rafael with the task of imprisoning the guardia Captain and the barrio\u2019s Spanish friar, Padre Hidalgo, in the name of the revolutionary government. But when the American troops chasing General Emilio Aguinaldo arrive, the Spanish officer and Padre Hidalgo are freed, and a garrison under the command of Lieutenant Ike Compton is left to \u2018protect\u2019 the barrio. The American occupation policy now changes from \u2018hearts and minds\u2019 to \u2018concentration\u2019  and Rafael has to answer to both the Americans and the Filipino patriots, with deadly consequences.\n"}
