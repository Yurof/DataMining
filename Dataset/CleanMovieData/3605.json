Particularly notable scenes of both the rally and the film are images of Albert Speer's lighting techniques during the 9th Nuremberg rally on 10 September 1937, in which he positioned 134 spotlights circling the Zeppelin field on which the rally was taking place. The beams of these spotlights, forming the \"Cathedral of Light,\" merged into the general glow at an estimated height of 20,000 feet.\n"}
