Robert denies seeing the alleged poacher, and the fight which ensues is destined to seal his fate. When Sir Jeffrey\u2019s brother, Roger of Doncaster, learns that Robert of Loxley was not killed for his insolence, he determines to use the incident to have him arrested and his lands confiscated. Sir Roger\u2019s ulterior motive is that his intended bride Lady Marian Fitzwater has had feelings for Robert from childhood and this stands in the way of his marriage to her. So he enlists the help of the Abbott to have Robert made a Wolfshead: an outlaw who\u2019s head is worth that of a wolf\u2019s, dead or alive.\n"}
