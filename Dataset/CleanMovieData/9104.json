{"wikiId": "35336357", "titre": "Katanga Business", "dateSortie": "2009-04-01", "duree": "120.0", "genre": ["Documentary"], "resume": "The province of Katanga in the south east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  has huge mineral riches including uranium, zinc, copper and cobalt. These were exploited in colonial times by the Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga, which was nationalized in 1966 by President Mobutu Sese Seko. Mobutu lavished wealth on his clan, but the mines were soon abandoned, forcing the miners into illegal artisanal workings. More recently new investors have bought into the industry including Indians and Chinese. Katanga Business highlights the charismatic governor of the province, the populist Moses Katumbi. It shows the great wealth of the province and the abject poverty of the miners.\n"}
