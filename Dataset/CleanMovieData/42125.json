Days later Johnny Styles wins the American kickboxing championship and is approached by Negaal\u2019s men for an invitation, but Matt Reeves, Johnny\u2019s friend and teacher, becomes suspicious about it. That night Johnny is murdered by Negaal's men, but not without Reeves arriving and beating them. Now wanting revenge, Matt Reeves travels to South Africa to chase after Negaal himself and joins a fighter, Paul Croft, who Negaal ordered to kill Reeves but disobeyed. In South Africa they encounter and fight Negaal\u2019s men in a cat and mouse game throughout the film, going to prison in a trap set up by one of Negaal\u2019s henchmen and escaping it heading to Croft\u2019s home. Meanwhile Negaal recruits more fighters into his organization, with himself fighting and killing the German champion when he refused to join, and killing one of his own men for failing to get Reeves. Reeves, Croft, and Croft's sister arrive in Negaal\u2019s mansion during the organization\u2019s inauguration party, and they expose to the public Negaal\u2019s true intentions and crimes. Matt Reeves fights his way to Negaal himself who is waiting at his office and the two men fight a duel to the death, with Reeves defeating and killing him.\n"}
