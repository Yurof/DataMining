{"wikiId": "7884497", "titre": "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", "dateSortie": "1913-03-06", "duree": "26.0", "genre": ["Short Film", "Science Fiction", "Horror", "Black-and-white"], "resume": "Dr. Henry Jekyll  sends a note to his fianc\u00e9e, Alice , and her father  to say that instead of accompanying them to the opera, he must give more time to his charity patients. At Jekyll\u2019s practice, his friends Dr. Lanyon  and Utterson , a lawyer, ridicule him for what they consider his dangerous research. Alice and her father also visit Jekyll\u2019s rooms, but although apologetic, the doctor insists on devoting his time to his patients. That night, however, Jekyll undertakes a dangerous experiment, swallowing a drug intended to releases his evil self. His body convulses, and he transforms into a hunched, twisted figure. The strange creature emerges from Jekyll\u2019s room, bearing a note in Jekyll\u2019s handwriting that orders the household staff to treat the stranger \u2013 \u201cMr Hyde\u201d \u2013 as himself. Hyde then slips out into the night, terrorising the patrons of a nearby tavern before finding himself lodgings. From these rooms he begins a career or evil, until one night he attacks and injures a crippled child. Outraged witnesses corner Hyde and force him to agree to compensate the boy. Hyde reluctantly leads one man back to Jekyll\u2019s house and gives him money. During this passage of events, a worried Dr. Utterson sees Hyde entering Jekyll\u2019s house. Inside, Hyde takes a potion that transforms him back to Jekyll. The doctor swears that he will abandon his experiments and never tempt fate again; but that night, without taking the drug, he turns spontaneously into Hyde.\n"}
