From the onset, the two had dreams in opposite directions. Harilal wanted to study abroad and become a barrister like his father, while Gandhi hoped that his son would join him and fight for his ideals and causes. When Gandhi doesn\u2019t give Harilal the opportunity to study abroad, it comes as a huge and almost unforgivable blow to Hari. He decides to abandon his father\u2019s vision and leaves South Africa for India where he joins his wife Gulab  and kids. He goes back to school to earn his diploma but fails three times in a row and ends in a financial dump. Each of his schemes to make money falls through and he ends up building a horrible reputation for himself, all the while tarnishing his father\u2019s name. Sick of his failure, Gulab returns to her parent\u2019s house with the kids and Hari stumbles and eventually falls. He turns to alcohol for solace and shuffles back and forth between Hinduism and Islam, in a never-ending search for peace. With political tension heating up, the rift between Gandhi and his eldest son grows until it\u2019s beyond repair. This is the story of a man who lived in the enormous shadow of his father, striving to discover his identity.\n"}
