As the film begins, Paul and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, a wealthy Parisian couple, are preparing to go out for the evening. While driving, they see three men chasing a prostitute down the street. She begs them to save her by letting her into the car, but Paul locks the doors and drives away as the three men beat her, leaving her unconscious in the street. He refuses to let H\u00e9l\u00e8ne phone an ambulance, afraid of being charged with not helping a person in danger . H\u00e9l\u00e8ne cannot forget the incident, and the next day she goes to the hospital, where she finds the prostitute, No\u00e9mie, in a coma. Moved, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne stops work and leaves her family responsibilities to stay with No\u00e9mie throughout her recovery, aiding her as she regains mobility and helping her to communicate since she can't yet speak. When one of the pimps returns to threaten No\u00e9mie, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne follows him out of the hospital, knocks him unconscious, and leaves him for the police to find. Meanwhile, Paul and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's son Fabrice, a university student, is cheating on his girlfriend with another girl, who is pregnant. When his girlfriend discovers the truth, she destroys his apartment. He moves into Paul's apartment just as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne moves out, and the two girls follow him, much to Paul's chagrin. When H\u00e9l\u00e8ne returns home for a day, one of No\u00e9mie's pimps goes to the hospital with a friend and removes No\u00e9mie under the pretense that they are relatives taking her for a walk. No\u00e9mie, who still cannot speak, is unable to protest. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne meets them on the sidewalk and, realizing that No\u00e9mie is not safe at the hospital, \"kidnaps\" her and brings her to Paul's mother's house. Here No\u00e9mie recovers her ability to talk, and relates her life story: her name is actually Malika, and she is a French-Algerian immigrant. As Malika recovers, the two plan Malika's freedom and revenge on her abusers. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's life changes forever as the selfishness of her husband and son becomes apparent.\n"}
