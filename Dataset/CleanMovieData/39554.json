{"wikiId": "17044747", "titre": "Who's Who in the Zoo", "dateSortie": "1942-02-14", "duree": "7.0", "genre": ["Short Film", "Family Film", "Animation"], "resume": "This is one of the cartoons that Warner would occasionally produce that featured few or none of its stable of characters, just a series of gags, usually based on outrageous stereotypes and plays on words, as a narrator  describes the action. This one is somewhat different in that Porky Pig  appears, as the zookeeper of the \"Azusa Zoo\". Some excerpts: *In a comic \"triple\", a timber wolf is shown, then a gray wolf, then a \"Hollywood wolf\" . *Other creatures include a \"missing lynx\", a \"tortoise and the hair\", \"March hares\" who march to a drumbeat, a down-on-his-luck \"bum steer\", an Indian elephant playing an American Indian, and a bald eagle wearing a toupee. *There is also a running joke about a lion who is awaiting the arrival of the ice cream truck.\n"}
