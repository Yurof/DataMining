The workmen are anthropomorphic animals in human clothes. Elevators, picks, shovels, and a steam shovel are instruments in music making and construction. As the clock nears 5:00 PM, the crew works furiously, and the building rises toward the clouds. With the pennant planted at the top and the work completed, the foreman takes a bow. One of the workers  leaves last, closing the door behind him. Due to this, the building  comes crashing down.\n"}
