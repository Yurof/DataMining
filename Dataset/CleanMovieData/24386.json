{"wikiId": "4409408", "titre": "The House of Sand", "dateSortie": "2006-07-28", "duree": "115.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Art film", "World cinema"], "resume": "In 1910, pregnant \u00c1urea  along with her mother, Maria  arrive at a remote, desert-like part of the Brazilian state of Maranh\u00e3o -- called the Len\u00e7\u00f3is Maranhenses -- where her fanatical husband Vasco de S\u00e1  has relocated the family from the state's capital, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, to start a farm. Soon the white settlers realize that they are not alone: a group of descendants of runaway slaves live in the area, in a settlement\u2014generally known as a quilombo -- they call \"The Island\" because it is the only permanently fertile spot in a sea of sand where it rains only during the rainy season. Due to the madness of Vasco, Maria seeks to bribe the black settlers to take her and her daughter away, but they, while taking her money , do no such thing. However, soon enough Vasco's workers abandon the farm. Vasco, enraged over this betrayal, dies when he accidentally buries himself under a heap of construction material for the half-finished house. This leaves the two women with no way of returning to the city. Left to their own devices, the two women venture out to explore the area. They find a fishing hut on the shores of the ocean and notice that Massu , the fisherman, has salt which he regularly obtains from his father who lives in the nearby Island. Massu takes them there, as they seek to follow the salt trail out of the desert. However, Massu's father does not know where the salt comes from since he is the grandson of a runaway slave; he already had been born in the sanctuary; he does not know the world beyond the confines of the Island. Yet soon they establish contact with the itinerant trader who brings the salt , but he too does not offer any viable connection back to the civilization Maria and \u00c1urea grew up in. Unable to return for now, \u00c1urea and Maria get settled and with the help of Massu start a small farming operation. About ten years after their arrival, \u00c1urea still longs to return to her former life beyond the seemingly insurmountable dunes, while her mother seems quite content in their new situation since she feels she does not have anything worthwhile to return to. Quietly, \u00c1urea has been purchasing beasts of burden to venture out of the sandy trap. In fact, when the old trader dies, \u00c1urea, following a fresh trail in the sand by herself, sets out to return her family to civilization as she knew it. This civilization she finds in the form of an international scientific expedition that, for the purpose of observing an annular solar eclipse on May 29, 1919, had come to the remote desert to verify claims made by Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity concerning the curvature of space.This expedition, headed by British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington, is a historical fact. One party observed the eclipse on the island Pr\u00edncipe, to the west of equatorial Africa's coast; another did the same in Brazil. However, the Brazilian location was not Maranh\u00e3o but rather Sobral, Cear\u00e1. \u00c1urea falls in love with Luiz, a young soldier escorting the expedition, whom she also asks to request permission for her and her family to return home with the scientists. The permission is granted, and \u00c1urea hurries back home to bring her mother and daughter to where the expedition is. However, when she returns to her \"house of sand,\" the dunes have further encroached upon her house; she fears that her mother and daughter  are buried under the sand. This turns out not to be the case\u2014the mother had died, the daughter had found refuge with Massu\u2014but precious time is lost: they miss the expedition. However, Luiz had not only told her that he wanted to join the newly established Brazilian Air Force; he had also told her that the scientists would come back in a few months to continue their studies. This is why she and her daughter check back regularly where the expedition had established a geodesic marker since \u00c1urea does not want to stay in the desert mainly because, as she confides to her daughter, she misses \"real music,\" that is, the classical music she played on the piano when she was younger. The expedition returns but \u00c1urea misses it. Massu, who saw it with his son, did not tell her about it. Finally, when Aurea realizes that she had missed her lifeline back to her world, she resigns herself to her fate and links up with Massu. As young Maria grows older, \u00c1urea is troubled by the fact that she, out of boredom, has become a drunk and cheap prostitute for the young men of the Island. Maria does not want to establish a family but instead aborts her pregnancies. Their fate is fundamentally altered when, in 1942 , a Brazilian military plane crashes in the ocean nearby. A search party is sent out that is commanded by Luiz, now a high-ranking officer with the Brazilian Air Force. Luiz, who is married, first sees Maria and is reminded by her of her mother \u00c1urea . Eventually, he meets \u00c1urea in person who begs him to take Maria with him. This he does, promising to look after her, while \u00c1urea contently stays with Massu in the desert. About three decades later, Maria finally returns to the house she grew up in. She finds her gray-haired mother, sitting by herself at their old kitchen table. They happily reunite, and Maria brings deep joy to \u00c1urea when she plays a tape-recording of \"real music,\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's Pr\u00e9lude \"Raindrops,\" op. 28, no. 15. Contemplating the moon together, Maria tells her mother that man had landed on the moon . \u00c1urea, remembring a conversation she had with Luiz fifty years earlier concerning Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, asks her daughter whether the astronauts, travelling at high speed in a rocket, returned younger than they left. Maria, unlike her seemingly isolated mother not acquainted with the Twin paradox , states that they returned older. When asked what they found on the moon, Maria replies: Nothing but sand.\n"}
