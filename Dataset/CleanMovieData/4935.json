Ver\u00f3nico Cruz (Gonzalo Morales  is a poor indigenous Argentine shepherd boy who lives in the desolate and harsh Andean highlands. He lives in Chorc\u00e1n, a small hamlet in the Jujuy Province. One day Mr. Lehrer  arrives in Chorc\u00e1n to take the job as the new school teacher. Ver\u00f3nico comes to idolize his new teacher, who is also known as el maestro as a sign of respect and affection. At one point in the film el maestro takes Ver\u00f3nico on his first road trip to San Salvador de Jujuy, the capital of the Jujuy Province, to look for Ver\u00f3nico's father, who the boy has never met. While there Lehrer is interrogated harshly by government authorities and discovers Castulo Cruz is considered a subversive by the military and that he probably has become a desaparecido. As Ver\u00f3nico Cruz learns about the outside world from his teacher, so too does Lehrer come to understand and appreciate the indigenous people who live in northwest rural Argentina and their history. Lehrer, near the end of the film, is given a promotion and leaves Ver\u00f3nico's small village to teach at a larger school far away. However, the warm relationship between el maestro and Ver\u00f3nico is tragically cut short after Ver\u00f3nico joins the navy and Argentine troops invade the Falkland Islands.\n"}
