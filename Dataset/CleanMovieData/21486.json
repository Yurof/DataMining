She offers to invest $25,000 in a Broadway show if her boyfriend, producer Larry Blair, casts her in the starring role. What she doesn't realize is Larry is two-timing her with ingenue Beatrice Darcy, who he envisions as the lead. When he accepts Nanette's offer, she imposes upon her wealthy, penny-pinching uncle, J. Maxwell Bloomhaus, to lend her the money. He's willing to do so, on one condition - for the next 24 hours, his niece must answer \"no\" to every question she's asked. Comic complications ensue when the cast arrives at Nanette's estate to rehearse, and composer and pianist Jimmy Smith, who has romantic designs on the girl, falls victim to the bet she's made with her uncle. Nanette wins, only to discover Uncle Max has lost all his money in the stock market crash. The only person still solvent is attorney William Early, and Nanette's assistant Pauline Hastings sets out to charm him into backing the show.\n"}
