Beh\u00e7et  is the only son of a father, in whom the government and the bureaucracy take a close interest due to his strong influence in Antakya. While he is working as an assistant researcher in the faculty of law in Istanbul, he falls under the sway of the extreme nationalist movement as a result of his upbringing and the influential role model of his father. The only thing that causes Beh\u00e7et to stumble on this is Elena, a woman he secretly observes from his apartment. She is a Greek prostitute, who has been exploited by her grandmother after her mother had left them. Elena is aware that she is being observed by Beh\u00e7et and falls in love with him. They get close to each other which does not please Beh\u00e7et's father and his political party. The death of his friend Suat and the role that his father plays with the leaders of the party to exterminate the opposition and even the tolerated voices force Beh\u00e7et to reconsider his political belonging. Beh\u00e7et finds Elena alive after being hit by the activist. He takes her and remembers the words she said while lying on the bed in her apartment.\n"}
