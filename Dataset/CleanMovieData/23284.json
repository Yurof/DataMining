A second version of the scene plays out identically, but then cuts to a cemetery where a caretaker is walking among the headstones whistling Fr\u00e8re Jacques. He hears the same tune coming from Amy's grave. Around the headstone lie a few of the same red flowers, and as the caretaker reaches for one, the music surges and the scene cuts to black.\n"}
