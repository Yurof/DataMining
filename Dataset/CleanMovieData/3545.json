{"wikiId": "496640", "titre": "The Barbarian Invasions", "dateSortie": "2003-05-21", "duree": "111.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Ensemble Film", "Comedy-drama", "Comedy", "Indie"], "resume": "Continuing seventeen years after Arcand's The Decline of the American Empire, the film centres on an exploration of the characters first met in the original film and their children, newly introduced. The older generation are still largely social-democrats and proponents of Quebec nationalism, but both political and economic developments after the \u201cQuiet Revolution\u201d of the 1960s, as well as their own aging, make their left-wing stance seem somewhat anachronistic. The plot revolves around the character R\u00e9my's battle with terminal cancer, and the efforts of S\u00e9bastien, his estranged son to make his dying father more comfortable in his last days. Finally the father and son travel to Vermont in the United States to receive medical care. S\u00e9bastien, at the request of R\u00e9my's ex-wife Louise, has reluctantly returned from London where he has a successful career in quantitative finance - anathema to his father's socialist persuasions. However, this background helps S\u00e9bastien to navigate and manipulate Quebec's healthcare system  to secure better care for his father. In the process, he also gathers the various other friends and family members from R\u00e9my's past who come to visit and comfort him. During R\u00e9my's last days, he and his friends travel to the cottage of the first film, and discuss philosophy, politics, and past sexual and intellectual exploits.\n"}
