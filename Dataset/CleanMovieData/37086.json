While going through his day, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric begins to ponder the times before he was married, when he was free to be with any woman he wanted and could feel the deep satisfaction of anticipation while he chased them. At one point in the film, he has an elaborate fantasy where he possesses a magical amulet that causes all women to bow to his will . These thoughts do not distress Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric though, as he sees these ideas as a reflection of how true his love to his wife is.
