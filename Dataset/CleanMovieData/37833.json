{"wikiId": "16807542", "titre": "I ragazzi di via Panisperna", "dateSortie": "1989", "duree": "123.0", "genre": ["Historical fiction", "Drama"], "resume": "The story is inspired by a real life fact and set in the 1930s when, at the Institute of Physics of Via Panisperna, in Rome, physicist Enrico Fermi managed to involve a group of brilliant young students\u2014Emilio, Bruno, Edoardo and Ettore \u2014forming a working group committed to scientific research who would achieve great discoveries in the field of nuclear physics. These young men's lives\u2014full of anxieties as well as enthusiasms\u2014are related with pathos and sensitiveness, mainly looking at their private side, with their youthful energies, but also their fears and weakness. The story has among the main themes the relationship between Enrico and Ettore, the former becoming both a sort of father and of elder brother to Ettore, with the typical disputes  happening in a family. Unfortunately, the fascist political regime, the racial laws, Ettore's disappearance into nowhere \u2014he who already realized how their exciting discoveries could become powerful destruction weapons in wrong hands \u2014all proves to be more decisive than the love for physics which had drawn them together so much and, finally, the boys turn different ways.\n"}
