{"wikiId": "3769379", "titre": "Herr Meets Hare", "dateSortie": "1945", "duree": "", "genre": ["Propaganda film"], "resume": "The cartoon opens with a faux Walter Winchell voice discussing the end of Germany, saying that \"Germany has been battered into a fare-thee-well\", and musing about where the high leadership, and \"Fatso\" G\u00f6ring in particular has gone. The scene soon cuts to the Black Forest, where Hermann G\u00f6ring, in bemedalled lederhosen, is \"soothing his jangled nerves\" marching while on a hunt. Nearby, a familiar furrow in the ground appears, with a hole at the end. Bugs pops out of the hole, and sees no sign of the Black Forest on his map. . Bugs asks G\u00f6ring about the directions to Las Vegas, oblivious to his location. G\u00f6ring is almost tricked into going to Las Vegas but then quickly realizes that he's being tricked and replies \"Las Veegas? Why, there is no Las Veegas in Chermany!\" For once genuinely alarmed by his mistaken destination, Bugs hightails it, saying \"'Joimany'? Yipe!\", with G\u00f6ring chasing after him shooting at him with his musket.  A few chase gags go by in which Bugs insults the integrity of G\u00f6ring's medals by bending one with his teeth. G\u00f6ring, suckered into bending one himself, declares them ersatz and mumbles all sorts of anti-Hitler sentiments . Bugs masquerades as Adolf Hitler using a bit of mud, and faces the surprised G\u00f6ring. G\u00f6ring disappears offscreen in a flash to change into his Nazi uniform adorned with all sorts of medals. After the usual Nazi salute, Bugs berates him in faux German as he strips G\u00f6ring of his medals  and even his belt, causing G\u00f6ring to \"kiss\" in reverence, saying in order: \"Look! I kiss mein F\u00fchrer's hand. I kiss right in der F\u00fchrer's face!\", the joke being the wildly popular song of the time of the same name composed by Oliver Wallace and played by Spike Jones's band, and the subject of a rival short animated subject from the Walt Disney Studios. Afterwards, G\u00f6ring exclaims, \"Oh, I'm a bad flooten-boy-glooten!\", a variant on Warner cartoons' frequently-cited Lou Costello catchphrase, \"I'm a baaad boy!\". Later, when the gig is up, Bugs rides in on a white horse, dressed as Br\u00fcnhilde, from Wagnerian opera, to the tune of the \"Pilgrims' Chorus\" from Tannh\u00e4user. G\u00f6ring, entranced, responds by dressing up as Siegfried. The two dance, before Bugs once again makes a fool of G\u00f6ring and escapes . Eventually, G\u00f6ring captures Bugs, using a hawk. \"Do you think he'll catch me, doc?\" \"Will he catch you? He'll have you back here faster thank you can say Schicklgruber.\"  The hawk imitates Jimmy Durante. G\u00f6ring brings Bugs back to Hitler , where he identifies him as \"Bugsenheimer Bunny\"  to der F\u00fchrer.During this final sequence, realistic hand prints are visible on a wall map. These prints represent a signature of background artist Robert Gribbroek, who is not credited in this film. As Herr Hitler talks of the great rewards he is going to pile upon G\u00f6ring for this act of heroism, he opens the bag to reveal Bugs dressed as Joseph Stalin\u2014complete with an enormous pipe\u2014staring back at him. G\u00f6ring and Hitler flee. As the cartoon ends, Bugs glances back at the camera and asks, in a Russian accent, citing an ad slogan of that era for the \"Sir Walter Raleigh\" pipe tobacco manufactured by the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company: \"Does your tobacco taste different lately?\"\n"}
