Alex is a street performer addicted to alcohol and sedatives and Mich\u00e8le a painter driven to a life on the streets because of a failed relationship and a disease which is slowly destroying her sight. The film portrays their harsh existence living on the bridge with Hans, an older vagrant. As her vision deteriorates Mich\u00e8le becomes increasingly dependent on Alex. When a possible treatment becomes available, Mich\u00e8le's family use street posters and radio appeals to trace her. Fearing that she will leave him if she receives the treatment, Alex tries to keep Mich\u00e8le from becoming aware of her family's attempts to find her. The streets, skies and waterways of Paris are used as a backdrop for the story in a series of set-pieces set during the French Bicentennial celebrations in 1989.\n"}
