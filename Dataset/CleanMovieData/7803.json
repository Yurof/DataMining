Only pain can make people feel alive. Jack , a young man and former neurosurgeon, is a peddler of substances that induce pain. A stranger knocks on Jack\u2019s door and hands him a single video tape that Jack\u2019s long lost father, Ed Alexander Crowley , left behind. It is the first in a series of 10 tapes in which Ed has documented his life and his pursuit of what he calls the \u201cGrand Conspiracy,\u201d a conspiracy that quite possibly could be the answer to what happened to Jack\u2019s world. Inspired by his father\u2019s tape, Jack sets out on his own investigation. But in order to solve the whole puzzle, he must locate the remaining nine tapes. Jack begins to track down four more tapes, but the larger answer still eludes him. Jack meets the provocative Lisa  in a strip club, and is struck by the fact that she is just as conflicted and lonely as he is. Through her, Jack encounters the possibility of real love. As Jack finds the remaining tapes, the lines between his interior and exterior world blur, leading him to question reality itself. Lisa and Jack decide to abandon the search for the tapes and leave the city. Jack locates Ed\u2019s last tape, and is suddenly faced with the same choice his father had to make forty years ago: to surrender his soul, or to remain true to himself, no matter the consequences. Jack's reality becomes the same reality as the final tape. The final scene reveals Jack as an institutionalized patient  with both a brain tumour and epilepsy taking part in a clinical research trial in 2012. The movie ends with him scribbling notes about Zenith while being monitored by a camera in his cell. He wonders if this isn't another part of the conspiracy.\n"}
