He goes to Jecheon to judge the local film festival, but the common practice for jurors is to schmooze by day, drink at night, and sleep through movies. He bumps into an old friend Bu Sang-yong in town and drinks till he passes out, but not before soundly offending his friend's wife. After Jecheon, Ku heads to Jeju Island to give a college lecture. There he meets up with a former mentor, who it turns out is now married to Ku's college sweetheart.Moon Seok. \"Return of the Masters\". Korean Film Observatory No.28, pp. 16.
