The film follows the Reverend's \"shopping interventions/actions\" into cultural dead zones within the island of Manhattan such as Starbucks, Disney and the New York University construction site at the Edgar Allan Poe House. Reverend Billy, a.k.a. Bill Talen, is an actor/performance artist and a leading figure in the anti-globalization movement. His work combines the forces of social and political change with the means of theater arts to counteract our media culture. His artistic and political work is influenced by various concepts of \"street theater.\" His disruptions or \"shopping interventions\" in public spaces are in the tradition of the Living Theater, Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, Lenny Bruce, The Yippies. New York Times theater critic Jonathan Kalb calls his work \"the most hilarious and pointed political theater in New York, something that has to be done in the risky environment of the street.\" The actions/performances inside and outside of Starbucks coffee shops and Disney stores often end with the Reverend being arrested. He calls it stepping into somebody's imagined box. The police call it illegal trespassing. The Reverend claims that social change always begins with civil disobedience and includes as his heroes the civil rights, peace and labor movements. Americans, according to Reverend Billy, lead fake lives: we gobble up the mono-culture peddled by transnational conglomerates; we buy whatever stores sell us; and, consequently, we live consumerist fictions. We become, in his words, \u201ctourists in our own lives.\u201d Dietmar Post and Lucia Palacios\u2019s REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP SHOPPING focuses on Reverend Billy  and his devout group of disciples as they crusade against the synthetic and corruptive aspects of today\u2019s hyper-consumerist culture. Talen tirelessly labors to organize \u201cactions\u201d\u2014ranging from choir-singing protests to rooftop speeches\u2014that urge people to stop shopping and to realize the threat lurking beneath the veneer of commodification. Working to create real change through his activism, Talen leads his followers to the streets to recite \u201cThe Raven\u201d in protest of NYU\u2019s planned demolition of the Edgar Allan Poe House. Concerned with how transnational corporations \u201ccolonize\u201d our mental-scapes and destroy local neighborhoods, the charismatic \u201cpreacher\u201d thrives on staging infiltrations of the Disney Store or boycotts of Starbucks, even if it means frequent run-ins with the NYPD. In the style of Direct Cinema, filmmakers Dietmar Post and Lucia Palacios expertly observe\u2014without interruption\u2014Reverend Billy in action and confrontation. As a result, the most rewarding aspect of REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP SHOPPING is its proficiency in accessing Talen\u2019s truly human side\u2014his humor, self-deprecation, and intelligence\u2014which in turn reveals what is genuinely empowering and inspiring about the man and his mission.\n"}
