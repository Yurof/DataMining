On the way, they see a poster which promotes a money-rich skii contest. Beans wants to give it a shot as he puts on his gear. Just then, a large oppressive cougar overhears Beans, approaches him, takes his skis off and breaks them before walking away. Beans still wants to participate and removes the rails from his sled using them as substitute skis. Moments later, the contest begins and all the competitors met at the starting line. Everyone sets off but the cougar has made Beans have a slow start. Nevertheless, Benas still makes his move and catches up, avoiding the cougar's further trickery as he puts all other contestants out of the race. Finally its just the cougar and Beans. As they approach the finishing line, the cougar is hurled onto thin ice and falls into the water below. Beans makes it safely across the finish line and wins the contest.\n"}
