The film then takes a step back to the start, in the form of a flashback. The year is 1952: Eva Per\u00f3n has retired from public life due to poor health, and her final days are being broadcast on the radio. Corval\u00e1n, alias \"El Pibe\"  and Santana  are two amateur private detectives living off oddjobs and gambling. Corval\u00e1n is also in a decaying relationship with Perla . After one unlucky day at the tracks, Corval\u00e1n meets a mysterious woman, Gloria , in a caf\u00e9. She passes him her telephone number and leaves. Corval\u00e1n tries to contact her, but unsuccessfully so until he is reached by Gloria herself, and presented with an assignment: trail a man, Nicol\u00e1s Pertureta, all day and report his movements. Although Pertureta proves difficult to follow, Corval\u00e1n manages to garner information about Pertureta contacting a number of shady people. Corval\u00e1n recruits his cautious partner, Santana, into the assignment - while keeping his regular tasks in hand. Perla is caught cheating on Corval\u00e1n, Pertureta is found strangled with barbed wire, and it is revealed that Gloria is the wife of a major mafia boss, \"El Noruego\" , who is being stalked by Dino Capuano, the last surviving member of a family he massacred years ago in Sicily. Because El Noruego suspects a snitch, and Gloria fears for her safety, she confesses to Corval\u00e1n that she hired him to give her, and indirectly her husband, proof that the snitch is Pertureta. Santana wants no business with the feud between El Noruego and Dino Capuano, but Corval\u00e1n, moved by Gloria's story, decides to help her, and together they go into hiding at a safehouse. It is here that the movie catches up with the start, and Corval\u00e1n engages in a gunfight with El Noruego's henchmen. He and Gloria escape after killing one of them, and as Corval\u00e1n runs out of bullets, Santana arrives and rescues them. Upon getting word that El Noruego and his gang have been gunned down by Capuano's men, Gloria manages to convince Corval\u00e1n to disappear with her. To do so, Corval\u00e1n must first return to El Noruego's place and open the safe that holds savings worth a lifetime. In the movie's climax, Corval\u00e1n manages to open the safe and reads the \"Remington\" seal in the safe-box and remembers that days ago his father told him he had a safe-box with a five-digit combination.Corval\u00e1n is suddenly interrupted by Gloria's chauffeur, who points a gun at him and demands the money. Just as he is about to kill him, he is shot in the back by Gloria as he, in turn, shoots Corval\u00e1n. Gloria leaves Corval\u00e1n to die, and walks away with the money. In the last scene, Santana painfully identifies Corval\u00e1n's body at the morgue. He mutters \"So long, my friend\"  and leaves. In the radio, a speaker announces the death of Eva Per\u00f3n and the national mourning.\n"}
