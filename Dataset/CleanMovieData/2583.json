One day, his estranged stepfather Ry\u016bji Sone  suddenly returns home and begins to freeload off his family. After Sh\u016bichi encounters what appeared to be Sone making sexual advances towards Haruka one night, he tries to get rid of Sone. However, Sh\u016bichi discovers that it is impossible to do so legally. During his art class, he secretly returns home to a sleeping Sone. After thorough research and experimentation on electrocution, he carries out his plan and kills his stepfather. The police declares that Sone had died of natural causes. Sh\u016bichi continues his everyday life and begins seeing classmate Noriko Fukuhara . One day, Takuya Ishioka , a classmate who skips school and causes trouble, goes to see him at the convenience store where he works. Ishioka, who knows what Sh\u016bichi did, threatens to tell the police if Sh\u016bichi does not get him 300,000 yen  in a week. In his room, Haruka reveals to him that Sone had been dying of cancer. Although Sh\u016bichi regrets his actions, in order to keep Ishioka quiet, he fools Ishioka into staging a robbery at his workplace. Sh\u016bichi stabs him, making it look like an act of self-defense. However, police officer Masashi Kano , who also met Sh\u016bichi at the time of Sone's murder, finds flaws in Sh\u016bichi's claims and actions. While seeing Noriko home at the train station, Sh\u016bichi admits to her that he is a murderer. The police manages to uncover the truth of what really happened to Sone and Ishioka, but Kano lets Sh\u016bichi go home on the basis that he promises to willingly turn himself in the next day. After having breakfast as usual with his family and leaving a tape-recording for Noriko at school, Sh\u016bichi commits suicide. In his tape-recording, Sh\u016bichi talks about his favorite things. Noriko stops coloring her drawing of a future Sh\u016bichi blue to listen.\n"}
