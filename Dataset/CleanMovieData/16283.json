{"wikiId": "6149264", "titre": "Snakes on a Train", "dateSortie": "2006-08-15", "duree": "91.0", "genre": ["Thriller", "B-movie", "Horror", "Natural horror films"], "resume": "Although taking the same basic idea from Snakes on a Plane , the background story of how the snakes end up on the train is completely different. In the movie, writer Eric Forsberg created a woman who has been put under a Mayan curse which causes snake eggs to hatch inside her belly and eat their way out. In order to recover the \"lost pieces\" of herself , she must travel to Los Angeles where a powerful Mayan shaman can lift the curse. She takes the snakes along with her in small jars. While on the train, bandits attack her, allowing the snakes to escape and endanger the rest of the passengers. Eventually, and inexplicably, she herself transforms into a gigantic snake and swallows the moving train whole. Six passengers managed to escape unharmed and one of them performs magic to make her vanish.\n"}
