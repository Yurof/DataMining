Tom quickly rises from apprentice to leading gangster by being more vicious and ruthless than his rivals. The bootlegging business becomes an ever more lucrative operation, and Tom and Matt are not shy about flaunting the trappings of gangsterism. Tom does not forget about his more humble origins, and offers support to his pathetically doting, and now widowed, mother. This brings him into conflict with his older brother, Mike Powers (Donald Cook , a shell-shocked war veteran who strongly disapproves of his loathsome little brother. Arguably, underlying the fraternal conflict is the fact that Tom\u2019s vicious immorality has brought generous material rewards while the straight-and-narrow path chosen by his brother has only produced a bitter casualty of war. Tom considers Mike self-righteous and hypocritical. When Mike quips that Tom's success is based on nothing more than \u201cbeer and blood\u201d , Tom retorts: \u201cYour hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.\u201d Tom continues his rise in gangland, but eventually his greed catches up with him when he challenges another gang, precipitating a catastrophic gang war. Arguably, the most famous scene is Tom \u201cgetting it\u201d in the end, graphically setting the tone for the \u201ccrime doesn\u2019t pay\u201d theme that dominated crime films for the rest of the decade and beyond.\n"}
