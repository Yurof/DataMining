{"wikiId": "12218502", "titre": "The Assassination of the Duke of Guise", "dateSortie": "1908-11-17", "duree": "11.0", "genre": ["Short Film", "History", "Silent film", "Drama"], "resume": "Lasting longer than was then usual, about 15 minutes, the film more or less accurately depicts the events of the day in 1588 when King Henri III  summoned his powerful rival, Duke Henri de Guise, to his chambers at the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois and had him brutally murdered. The film has its share of lurid thrills, and the pacing is quick throughout, with better acting than most films of the time, and staged in a somewhat theatrical manner.\n"}
