She arrives on the Caribbean island of \"Rinidad\" to perform as the headliner in a revue at the Paradise Hotel. Gertie has earned the nickname \"Dirty Gertie\" for the casual nature in which she entices and then humiliates men. On the island she attracts the attention of two US military officers--a soldier and a sailor--whom she nicknames \"Tight Pants\" and \"High Pockets,\" respectively. The men enjoy sharing Gertie\u2019s affections. However, Diamond Joe, the owner of the hotel, finds himself falling for Gertie and begins to shower her with gifts. Gertie also attracts the attention of two missionaries, Mr. Christian and Ezra Crumm, who keep watch on Gertie\u2019s activities. However, a former boyfriend from Harlem tracks Gertie to the island. Unable to possess her, the ex-boyfriend kills her while insisting that he loves her.Black Film Center/Archive, University of Indiana\u201cRun Chile Run: Critical Analyses of Three Films By Spencer Williams,\u201d Spring 1994, Sync: The Regent Journal of Film and Video, Regent University\u201cObituary: Francine Everett,\u201d The Independent , June 25, 1999\n"}
