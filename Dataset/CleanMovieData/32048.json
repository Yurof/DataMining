Miti\u0107 is an overweight 48-year-old man who is in an Oedipus kind of way connected to his aging mother. His mother often punishes him when he does not sell any of the carnation flowers. His punishments include kneeling on nutshells while being slapped by his mother or being locked in the water tank. This is the reason why he starts killing every girl who refuses to buy his flowers. Miti\u0107's character can be compared to Norman Bates's character and relationship with his mother. After the first murder, mostly incompetent inspector Ognjen Strahinji\u0107 (Nikola Simi\u0107  starts the investigation. His attempt to catch the strangler by employing an undercover agent, Rodoljub Jovanovi\u0107 , ends up tragically. Strahinji\u0107 is a loner who lives only with his cat George, who is his best friend. He is a short man, with a thin mustache and is similar to Inspector Clouseau from the Blake Edwards's The Pink Panther series. The plot gets even more complicated when a rock star Spiridon Kopicl  obsessed with the strangler records the song \"Bejbi, bejbi\" , with his band VIS Simboli, dedicated to the strangler which immediately became nationwide hit. Miti\u0107, having heard the song, becomes delighted; he even strangled his own mother in order to hear it on the TV. While Miti\u0107's number of victims becomes bigger, Kopicl is focused on Sofija  who is a host of a popular musical show on the radio. While attempting to strangle Sofija, Miti\u0107 gets on his way and while attacking her gets his ear bitten by Sofija in self defence. Kopicl gets the credit of a savior and a hero and gets married to Sofija. On their honey moon, in the climax of his obsession, Kopicl strangles Sofija while Miti\u0107, dressed as his mother, is watching the whole thing. Miti\u0107 then enters the room and asks for his ear. Kopicl runs to an abandoned building where, after a struggle, hangs Miti\u0107 who bit his ear. In the end all of the crimes, including Sofija's death, are credited to the late Miti\u0107. Kopicl, while getting his ear bitten hears a melody on which he composed a symphony inspired with crime and, after the death of his father, gets married to his attractive stepmother.\n"}
