In his opinion the outermost New York borough is a trove of history and culture that remains largely untapped due to a lack of mass transit alternatives. To that end, Dom proposes a \u201cseminal transit alternative\u201d for the Staten Island community. Under the rallying cry \u201cWhere mass transit has failed\u2026physics shall prevail!\u201d, Dom spearheads an initiative to build a large-scale catapult that launches commuters back and forth from Staten Island to downtown Manhattan in 5 minutes. Although his vision is initially met with bemusement and doubt, Dom soldiers on and eventually develops a prototype.\n"}
