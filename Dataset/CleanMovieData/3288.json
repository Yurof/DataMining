Their father, a journalist working with a local newspaper, and their mother, who gave birth just six months ago to their baby sister, Dilovan, are murdered by paramilitary forces. The kids are taken care of by their aunt, the sister of their late mother. However, a few weeks on, their aunt goes missing, too.
