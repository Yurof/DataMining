{"wikiId": "16113730", "titre": "Cheri", "dateSortie": "2009-02-10", "duree": "86.0", "genre": ["Romance Film", "Drama", "Comedy"], "resume": "Set in 1900s Belle \u00c9poque Paris, Ch\u00e9ri  tells the story of the end of a six-year affair between an aging retired courtesan, L\u00e9a, and a flamboyant young man, Fred, nicknamed \"Ch\u00e9ri\" . Although L\u00e9a only plans on keeping Ch\u00e9ri around for a short while, their affair turns into a six-year ordeal, in which L\u00e9a has begun paying for Ch\u00e9ri's expenses, and Ch\u00e9ri wears L\u00e9a's silk pajamas and pearls. The two believe their affair to be casual, and L\u00e9a learns from Charlotte that she has arranged for Ch\u00e9ri to marry the daughter of another courtesan, a barely eighteen-year-old named Edm\u00e9e. Although Ch\u00e9ri does not wish to marry Edm\u00e9e, it is made clear that he has no choice in the matter. L\u00e9a kicks him out of her home, but makes Ch\u00e9ri promise to always be gentle and kind with Edm\u00e9e, and to try and give her a good life. After Ch\u00e9ri agrees, the two part ways, and do not share glances at Ch\u00e9ri's wedding. It is only after Ch\u00e9ri is on the train to Italy for his honeymoon that both he and L\u00e9a realize they are in love with each other. Ch\u00e9ri rapes Edm\u00e9e and, while taking her virginity, realizes that while sex with Edm\u00e9e is strained and painful, sex with L\u00e9a was easy and fun. L\u00e9a visits Charlotte one last time before running off on vacation, making up a story in which she is involved in with another suitor, when in fact the only man L\u00e9a beds while on vacation is a young bodybuilder whom she has no feelings for and regards as a one-night-stand. Meanwhile, Edm\u00e9e accuses Ch\u00e9ri of not caring about her, and says all he ever does is think of L\u00e9a. While out on the town with a friend, Ch\u00e9ri tries opium and cocaine, and on his way back he notices that L\u00e9a's apartment is no longer empty, and she has returned home. Feeling refreshed, Ch\u00e9ri runs home to Edm\u00e9e where he makes love to her properly and kindly. He sends Charlotte the next day to inspect L\u00e9a's home, whereupon L\u00e9a says she is madly in love with her new \"suitor\", and learns  from Charlotte that Ch\u00e9ri and Edm\u00e9e are crazily in love and happier than ever. That night, after hearing from Charlotte that L\u00e9a is in love with her suitor, Ch\u00e9ri breaks into her home and admits he loves her. The two spend one more night together and plan on running away. In the morning, however, L\u00e9a apologizes to Ch\u00e9ri for \"ruining him\" and making life too easy on him when they first begun their affair. L\u00e9a tells Ch\u00e9ri to go back to Edm\u00e9e, for their age difference would always prevent a true relationship blossoming between them. Tentatively, Ch\u00e9ri leaves. L\u00e9a stares into her mirror at her aging face, and the narrator reveals she is angry for being born two decades before Ch\u00e9ri. The narrator also reveals that, after a while, Ch\u00e9ri realizes that L\u00e9a was the only woman he could ever love, and he commits suicide.\n"}
