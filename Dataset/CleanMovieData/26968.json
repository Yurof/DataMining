In Copenhagen, a high-ranking Soviet intelligence officer defects to the West with his wife and daughter. CIA agent Nordstrom  debriefs him and learns that Russian missiles are to be posted in Cuba. Nordstrom enlists the aid of his friend and French agent Andr\u00e9 Devereaux , encouraging him to accompany his daughter Mich\u00e8le  on her honeymoon with journalist Fran\u00e7ois Picard  as a premise to get him to New York. Andr\u00e9 accepts, but his wife Nicole  is worried for him. In New York, Andr\u00e9 entrusts a familiar contact, Philippe Dubois  to get hold of some seriously damaging papers concerning Soviet plans in Cuba from the visiting Cuban official Rico Parra . Parra is in New York to appear at the United Nations and stays at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem to show solidarity with \"the masses\". Dubois, taking the identity of a black journalist from Ebony, sneaks into the embassy , manages to take photos of some of the documents and then runs away, chased by Cuban revolutionaries. While cunningly dodging away, Dubois shams bumping into and overthrowing Andr\u00e9, who was watching events from the other side of the street, and slips the camera into his hand. A Cuban guard helps Andr\u00e9 to get up, stares at him, and lets him go.  The photos confirm that the Soviets are secretly transporting and placing missiles in Cuba. Devereaux, unheeding of his wife's fear and jealousy, jets off to Cuba to find out more details. He catches up with his mistress Juanita de Cordoba , widow to a former first-hour wealthy \"hero of the Revolution\", and herself now leader of the local underground resistance network: she acts undercover and collects information as Parra's lover. Andr\u00e9, on arriving, finds Parra leaving Juanita's mansion. During a scene of intimacy in the mansion, Devereaux asks her to somehow take photos of the missiles as they are unloaded from Russian boats at the harbour. But Juanita's people are arrested and tortured, while Parra's man, during a big mass rally and lengthy speech by the \"l\u00edder m\u00e1ximo\", recognizes Andr\u00e9's face from the incident in front of the hotel. Parra, who has heard from the maimed and tortured female underground member that Juanita is their leader, confronts Juanita and, hugging her in his arms, shoots her to save her from being tortured to death. In one of the film's most memorable shots, Juanita is seen from overhead, her dress spreading out on the floor like a bloodstain  on the big black-and-white pavement tiles, as she collapses. Andr\u00e9 is searched thoroughly at the airport on departure, but the Cuban authorities are unable to find the carefully hidden microfilms, which provide crucial information for the CIA about Soviet activities in Cuba. When Andr\u00e9 arrives back in Washington, he finds his home empty: his wife deserted him due to his Cuban love interest and returned to Paris. He is also recalled to Paris, but before he leaves, he is informed by Nordstrom about the existence of a Soviet spy organization called 'Topaz' within the French intelligence service. He is given the name of one certain member, NATO official Henri Jarr\u00e9 , who leaked documents to the KGB. On arrival, he attempts to get to the bottom of the leak, while his daughter Mich\u00e8le wants to reconcile her parents. He invites some of his old friends and colleagues, including Jarr\u00e9, to a lunch at a fine restaurant, \"Chez Pierre\". While Jarr\u00e9 eats, Andr\u00e9 tells the others about Topaz in order to provoke some reaction. Jarr\u00e9 answers that all this is a piece of misinformation, since he knows that the Russian official in fact died a year ago. But he begins to panic, and visits the man who is the leader of the spy ring, Jacques Granville . But Granville, in his night gown, is \"waiting for somebody\". As Jarr\u00e9 is leaving Granville's house, a woman arrives. It is Nicole, Andr\u00e9's wife, and as they kiss we see a photo on a stand: Devereaux, Nicole and Granville were old friends from their days together in the French Resistance. Devereaux sends his son-in-law Fran\u00e7ois to interview and extract information out of Jarr\u00e9. Fran\u00e7ois calls Devereaux from Jarr\u00e9's home, but the call is cut short. Devereaux and Mich\u00e8le rush together to Jarr\u00e9's flat, and find him dead. Fran\u00e7ois has disappeared. Andr\u00e9 and Mich\u00e8le return to Nicole's, and a short time later Fran\u00e7ois arrives: he was clubbed, but came to and managed to escape from his captors' car. He has overheard a phone number and shows a sketch of Jarr\u00e9. Nicole, who was staring at the window then turns around and tells her family, with tearful eyes, that the phone number is Granville's, so he must be the leader of the \"Topaz\" organization. Granville is exposed and then either  apparently commits suicide or  flees to the Soviet Union.\n"}
