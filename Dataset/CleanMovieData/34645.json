But Nandini\u2019s parents fix her marriage with another guy called Goutham . Though the picture was a remake of Kannada Superhit, did not run well in Andhra Pradesh. M.S. Raju, who gave biggest hits like Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana and Varsham, failed to recreate the same magic in this movie. Acting wise hero and heroine got good marks but story and screenplay didn't fit into the Telugu nativity.\n"}
