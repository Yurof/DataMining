After a decade of silence, he and his mother publicly speak about the life of their family member for the first time. In an attempt to end the cycle of violence and to ask for forgiveness Marroqu\u00edn travels to Colombia to meet the sons of two of his father's two most prominent murder victims: presidential candidate Luis Carlos Gal\u00e1n and Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara Bonilla as well as the son of the former Colombian president C\u00e9sar Gaviria.
