Tayfun has always been envious of the life led by the spoilt children of the jet set to whom he sells drugs. One day, with the intent of hitting it big, he steals Ate\u015f's money. However, Ate\u015f finds out about this and threatens Tayfun that he will have to pay for it. Frightened, Tayfun goes to another mafia boss, Sabri, for some idea of how to get the amount he owes to Ate\u015f. Sabri tells him that the best way to collect money is to run an illegal casino. However, all the venues run by Sabri are known by the police, so they need a \u201cclean\u201d place to set up the casino. \u00d6zg\u00fcr, one of the kids Tayfun sells drugs to, is the son of a well-to-do family that lives in a large mansion in an upscale neighborhood. Their house is the last place the police would think of raiding, so Tayfun and Sabri go to \u00d6zg\u00fcr's house to ask for his permission to turn the mansion into a casino. \u00d6zg\u00fcr, for the sake of some adrenaline, agrees to turn his family's mansion into an underground casino while his parents are away on an overseas trip.\n"}
