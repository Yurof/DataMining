For over a year, a Polish Catholic sewer maintenance worker and burglar thief Leopold Socha hid and cared for a group of hunted Jews who had escaped the massacres and deportations during the liquidation of the Lw\u00f3w Ghetto, at first helping them in exchange for a daily pay, but then continuing to do so long after the Jews' money run out and aiding them became ever more dangerous.\n"}
