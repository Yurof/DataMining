With the assistance of Aladdin, the Witch of the Fiery Mountain, and a magic horse, the title character reclaims the magic lamp and conquers the African sorcerer. The culminating scene in the film is the battle between \"die Hexe\"  and \"der afrikanische Zauberer\" , in which those characters undergo fabulous transformations. All is well in the end: Aladdin marries Dinarsade ; Achmed forces Pari Banu to marry him; the African sorcerer is defeated; and the foursome return to the Caliph's kingdom. Later Pari Banu- a goddess- steals a featherboa from Achmed so she can turn into a bird and fly home.\n"}
