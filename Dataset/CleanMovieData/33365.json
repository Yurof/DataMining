{"wikiId": "34288815", "titre": "La Luna", "dateSortie": "2011-06-06", "duree": "6.9", "genre": ["Short Film", "Computer Animation", "Animation"], "resume": "A young boy, Bambino, goes on a midnight sailing trip with his father Pap\u00e0 and grandfather Nonno. After they anchor their boat in the middle of the sea, Pap\u00e0 presents Bambino with a cap similar to the ones he and Nonno wear. The two men disagree on how Bambino should wear it, with Pap\u00e0 pulling it low over his eyes and Nonno pushing it back on his head. Pap\u00e0 sets up a long ladder for Bambino to climb so he can set the boat's anchor on the full moon, and the three ascend to start their work of sweeping fallen stars off the lunar surface. Pap\u00e0 urges Bambino to use a pushbroom on the stars, while Nonno favors a besom broom. As they quarrel, a huge star crashes down on the moon; it is far too large for any of them to move by themselves. Turning his cap backwards, the way he wants to wear it, Bambino climbs onto the star and taps it with a hammer. It bursts apart into hundreds of smaller stars, and all three go to work sweeping them up, with Bambino choosing a rake instead of either man's broom. Once the job is done, they climb back down into their boat and look up at the moon, which now displays a glowing crescent phase thanks to their efforts.\n"}
