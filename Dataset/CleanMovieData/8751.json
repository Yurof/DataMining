While cleaning out the apartment of his recent deceased mother, he discovers that the father he never knew is living in Marseilles. F\u00e9lix decides to hitchhike south to meet him, promising to see his lover Daniel there five days later. Carrying with him only a small bag, his HIV medication and a rainbow kite, F\u00e9lix takes to the road. He witnesses a racist attack and is beaten up by one of the assailants. He is unable, however, to bring himself to report it to the police. Later, F\u00e9lix encounters a series of people who form an alternative family for him: a young gay man studying art, who F\u00e9lix teaches to draw, a lone old widow, who shelters him in her house, a handsome railroad worker, with whom he has a brief sexual encounter, a mother of three children by three different fathers, and a kind, middle aged fisherman. As he calls each of these characters \"brother\", \"cousin\", \"grandmother\" and the like, he gradually constructs a sort of family and new understandings of life through this odyssey, no matter whether he actually meets his \"true\" father at the end of the story. F\u00e9lix is haunted by the racist crime he witnessed, in which he learns, the victim died, and in his inability to do anything about it. Stopping at a hotel, he sees the police arresting the murderer. When he arrives at Marseilles, Felix decides not to see his father and goes instead on a romantic holiday to Tunisia with his lover.\n"}
