When Lolotta dies he moves to an orphanage. At eighteen Tot\u00f2  leaves the orphanage and ends up in a shantytown squatter colony on the outskirts of Milan. Tot\u00f2's organizational ability learned at the orphanage and his simple kindness and optimistic outlook acquired from Lolotta bring structure to the colony and a sense of happiness and well being among the dispossessed who live there. Tot\u00f2 is given a magic dove by the ghost of Lolotta and he uses its powers to grant wishes to those who ask. Eventually the dove is taken back by two angels who object to a mortal using its magic powers. When oil is found in the shantytown capitalists acquire it and the squatters are taken away ostensibly to prison. On the way, however, the dove is returned to Tot\u00f2 and his wish for the freedom of his friends is granted. In a wonderful scene they fly away on broomsticks borrowed from the street sweepers in Milan's central square and circle around the Cathedral and then away into the sky, possibly to heaven. In a sense Tot\u00f2 is a Christ-like figure whose innate goodness and miraculous powers are corrupted by the human failings of the dispossessed, especially their simple-minded greed for clothes and money.\n"}
