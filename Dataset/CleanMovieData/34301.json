{"wikiId": "31521717", "titre": "Miyar House", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "76.0", "genre": ["Historical Documentaries", "Family Film", "Documentary"], "resume": "The filmmaker\u2019s 200 year old ancestral house is dismantled, giving him an opportunity to undertake a journey into a past. It is a past that he shares not only with his extended family, but also with successive generations of India\u2019s rural population. Armed with a cranky digital camera, he and his friend Ajay Raina sets out to document the dismantling process. They meet the four owners of the house \u2013 the uncles and aunt of the filmmaker - and gather from them what it means to undergo the process of change and migration. A sense of nostalgia and loss; as well as the excitement and the insecurity of the future accompany this process; the essence of which is transition. A realization of the inevitability of this transition marks this journey. It could well have been the journey of a country that has propelled itself into modernity. As plans are on for the house to get reconstructed elsewhere in an open air museum, out of its original context \u2013 for the filmmaker, the fossilization seems to be complete. The film ends with the tile that says that the filmmaker's father has expired in Mumbai in 2010.\n"}
