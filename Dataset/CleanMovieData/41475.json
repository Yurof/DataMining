He is coaxed back to his childhood home after his divorced father passes away and his mother, Christine, finds him a job in a calendar printing company in France. His mother implies the position is a creative role, and he prepares colourful drawings, each showing a disaster, for his \"disasterology\" calendar. However, nobody appreciates his talents and it transpires that his mother had led him on - the real vacancy is for nothing more than mundane typesetting work. While leaving his apartment to go to work one day, St\u00e9phane injures his hand helping his new neighbor move a piano into her apartment. The new neighbor, St\u00e9phanie, invites St\u00e9phane into her apartment  where her friend Zo\u00e9 tends to his wound. St\u00e9phane initially forms an attraction to Zo\u00e9, though he suspects it is instead St\u00e9phanie who likes him. St\u00e9phane realizes that St\u00e9phanie, like him, is creative and artistic. They plan a project for use in a short animated film. Following the advice of Guy, St\u00e9phane's sex-obsessed co-worker, St\u00e9phane pretends that he isn't St\u00e9phanie's neighbor, pretending to leave the building when he leaves her apartment. That night, when he is sleepwalking he writes a confusing note to St\u00e9phanie that asks for Zo\u00e9's phone number. St\u00e9phane realizes his mistake upon waking and retrieves the letter with a coat hanger, unaware that St\u00e9phanie has already read it. Surrealistic and naturalistic elements begin to overlap, and the viewer is often uncertain of which portions constitute reality and which are merely dreams. One such sequence, in which St\u00e9phane dreams his hands become absurdly giant, was inspired by a recurring nightmare director Michel Gondry had as a child. As this line gradually becomes more blurred, St\u00e9phane becomes more enamoured with St\u00e9phanie the more he spends time with her and shares his many inventions with her, such as the \"one-second time machine,\" a device that can go either forward or backward in time by only one second. St\u00e9phane's dreams encroach on his waking life as he tries to win St\u00e9phanie's heart and misses time at work. He breaks into her apartment, taking her stuffed toy horse, and implants a mechanism inside of it that will make it gallop. While putting it back into her apartment, St\u00e9phanie arrives and catches him, demanding he leaves and becoming more upset with him. Embarrassed and heartbroken, St\u00e9phane retreats to his own apartment where he receives a call from St\u00e9phanie, who apologizes and thanks him for the gift she discovers: a galloping version of \"Golden the Pony Boy,\" who she reveals was named after St\u00e9phane. As the months go by, waking and dreaming become even more intermixed. To St\u00e9phane's surprise, the calendar manufacturer accepts his \"Disastrology\" idea and it becomes a great success. A party is thrown in his honour, but he becomes depressed and begins drinking excessively after he witnesses St\u00e9phanie dancing flirtatiously with another man. The next day, St\u00e9phane and St\u00e9phanie have a confrontation in their hallway when St\u00e9phane announces that he doesn't want to be St\u00e9phanie's friend any longer. St\u00e9phanie becomes very upset, offering Zo\u00e9's phone number and reciting St\u00e9phane's note. St\u00e9phane, still unaware that St\u00e9phanie has read the note, assumes that they are connected through \"Parallel Synchronized Randomness\", a rare phenomenon he has examined in his dreams. St\u00e9phanie offers that they discuss their issues on a date, but on St\u00e9phane's walk to the caf\u00e9 to meet her, he has a frightful vision that she isn't there and she doesn't love him after all. He runs back to her apartment and bangs on her door, demanding that she stop torturing him; in actuality, she is indeed waiting for him at the caf\u00e9. St\u00e9phane runs at her door, attempting to break it down, but winds up bashing his head and collapsing in the hall, where his mother eventually finds him bleeding. Tired of waiting, St\u00e9phanie returns home while St\u00e9phane, coaxed by his mother and her friend, decides to move back to Mexico. Before leaving, St\u00e9phane's mother insists that he say goodbye to St\u00e9phanie. In his attempt to do so, he becomes extremely crass, making sexual and offensive jokes to her, and accusing her of never being able to finish something she starts. However, he reveals that he is truly interested in her because she's different from other people. As his antagonistic behavior pushes her to her breaking point, St\u00e9phanie asks St\u00e9phane to leave but he instead climbs into her bed and yells at her, before spotting two items on her bedside: his one-second time machine, and the finished boat they had planned to use in their animated film. St\u00e9phane falls asleep in St\u00e9phanie's bed. As she checks on him to see why he has become so quiet, she gently strokes his hair. The film closes with St\u00e9phane and St\u00e9phanie riding Golden the Pony Boy across a field before sailing off into the ocean's horizon in her white boat.\n"}
