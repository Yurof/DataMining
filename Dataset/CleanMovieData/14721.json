He summons Fran\u00e7ois Barras (Richard Hart , the only man who can nominate him before the National Convention. Barras refuses to do so and goes into hiding. Meanwhile, patriot Charles D'Aubigny  secretly kills and impersonates Duval , the bloodstained prosecutor of Strasbourg, who had been summoned to Paris by Robespierre for some unknown purpose . Neither Robespierre nor Fouch\u00e9 , the chief of his secret police, have met Duval before, so the substitution goes undetected. Robespierre informs D'Aubigny that his black book, containing the names of those he intends to denounce and have executed, has been stolen. Robespierre's numerous foes are kept in check by the uncertainty of whether their names are on the list. If they were to learn for certain that they are, they would band together against him. He gives D'Aubigny authority over everyone in France, save himself, and 24 hours to retrieve the book. D'Aubigny meets Barras (Richard Hart  through his sole contact, Madelon , whom D'Aubigny once loved. However, he was followed, and Barras is arrested by the police, led by Saint-Just. D'Aubigny finds himself in an uncomfortable position, but manages to allay the suspicions of both sides that he has betrayed them. He goes to visit Barras in prison, and informs him that three of his best men have been murdered. Strangely, their rooms had not been ransacked to search for the book, leading D'Aubigny to surmise that it was never stolen in the first place, and that Robespierre is using the alleged theft to distract his foes. Saint-Just, still suspicious, sends for Duval's wife to identify her husband. Through quick thinking, Madelon sends a friend to pretend to be Madame Duval and extricates her former lover. Before news of his impersonation gets out, D'Aubigny returns to Robespierre's private office to look for the book. There he encounters the opportunistic Fouch\u00e9, who is seemingly willing to sell out his master. When D'Aubigny finds the book, however, Fouch\u00e9 tries to stab him. D'Aubigny strangles him into unconsciousness and escapes. He and Madelon hide out at the farmhouse of a fellow conspirator, but their location is extracted through torture. A nighttime chase ensues. D'Aubigny gets away, but Madelon is caught, taken back to Paris, and tortured. She refuses to talk. As the Convention is about to convene the next day, Fouch\u00e9 shows up and offers to trade Madelon for the book. D'Aubigny turns him down. The book is passed from hand to hand among the delegates. Thus, when Robespierre arrives to denounce Barras, the crowd turns on him instead. He nearly brings the mob to heel with his golden words, but Fouch\u00e9 has his henchman shoot Robespierre through the jaw, silencing him. Robespierre is taken to meet Madame Guillotine. D'Aubigny searches Robespierre's office, finds a secret room, and rescues Madelon. Fouch\u00e9 meets an army officer in the crowd. When asked his name, the man replies, \"Bonaparte. Napoleon Bonaparte.\" Fouch\u00e9 promises to remember the name.\n"}
