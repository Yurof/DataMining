State\u2019s Mr. Langley \u2014 on behalf of Coach Wilson \u2014 takes the players on a trip to Bell Harbor, to convince them that State has much more to offer.  Rambling\u2019s Coach Hensen does not see anything he can do to stop it, given Rambling\u2019s limited resources, so the four girls take it on themselves to do whatever is required to convince the players to stay at Rambling. 1970s-era sex-comedy high jinks ensue as the girls compete with stuck-up State cheerleaders to get their players back. The Rambling U. cheerleaders succeed by infiltrating parties and meetings with sex, disguises and drugs. Not only do they keep their players, but they recruit State's star players, Mitch Stevens and Stanley Kraus, to boot.\n"}
