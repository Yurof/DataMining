Now a middle-aged man, he recalls a scene in his thirties. In the memory, Keiko tells him she is sorry. Yoshida then forces sex on her. In another apartment, Sh\u014dko, a woman in her early twenties, lies in bed while Tamura prepares to leave on a business trip. Sh\u014dko asks Tamura to buy her lipstick, and Tamura warns Sh\u014dko to behave herself while he is gone, since their wedding day is approaching. At City Hall Sh\u014dko requests a marriage application. A middle-aged man then asks for a registration for divorce. Meeting on the street, Mika apologizes to Sh\u014dko for her tardiness, then takes Sh\u014dko to a restaurant. The man who asked for divorce papers at City Hall is the owner of the restaurant. When Sh\u014dko indicates that she is having second thoughts about her wedding, Mika dismisses it as \"Marriage blues.\" At night, in bed in her apartment, Sh\u014dko slowly rips the marriage application in half. She rides her bicycle back to the restaurant, which is now closed. Kud\u014d recognizes Sh\u014dko from City Hall. They talk about the meaning of marriage, and Sh\u014dko seduces Kud\u014d in the kitchen. At her apartment Sh\u014dko listens to Tamura's phone message. He is angry because Sh\u014dko is not there, and says he will not buy the lipstick. Sh\u014dko returns to the restaurant in the morning. Yoshida awakens from a drunken stupor in his apartment then bursts into the restaurant in a rage trying to fight Kud\u014d. Riding Sh\u014dko home on her bike, Kud\u014d explains that Keiko, his wife, was originally Yoshida's girlfriend and first true love. At Keiko's home, Kud\u014d criticizes her for buying Minoru, the eldest of their two sons, a bicycle before Kud\u014d had given approval. Keiko says that because Kud\u014d is only at home on weekends she has to make the decisions. Angry, Kud\u014d leaves claiming he has work to do. Kud\u014d calls Sh\u014dko, who is packing in her apartment. He insists that Sh\u014dko meet him at the restaurant. At first reluctant, when she returns from seeing Kud\u014d, Sh\u014dko finds Tamura in her apartment. He angrily demands to know what she has been doing for the past few days. Sh\u014dko explains that she has decided not to go through with the marriage. Walking on the street while drinking sake, Yoshida passes out from an attack of abdominal pain. In his hospital room, Yoshida tells Kud\u014d that he has to remain in the hospital for another two or three days. As Kud\u014d is leaving the hospital a doctor stops him to talk about Yoshida's condition. Kud\u014d pays a surprise mid-week visit to Keiko. While cleaning up with tissues after a passionless bout of sex with her, Kud\u014d tells Keiko that Yoshida is sick, and that she should visit him. Tamura awakens with a hangover in bed with Mika. Because he doesn't remember the night before, Mika offers to have sex with him again. Tamura is confused and reluctant, but Mika persists. Meanwhile at the restaurant, Sh\u014dko tells Kud\u014d she isn't sure she loves him. While performing fellatio on him she comments that men taste bitter, but sweet. In the hospital, Yoshida is surprised by Keiko's visit. Yoshida advises Keiko not to go through with the divorce because he is alone in the world after his own divorce. He then has another attack. In the waiting room Kud\u014d tells Keiko that Yoshida actually has cancer, but that he has not been told. Back in the hospital room, Keiko tells Yoshida that he is not alone in the world. Kud\u014d overhears as Keiko explains that Minoru, her oldest boy, is actually Yoshida's son. Sitting in the park, Keiko tells Kud\u014d that Yoshida was not bitter or angry after she left him for Kud\u014d. Handing Kud\u014d an application for divorce, she asks if he can still love Minoru. Later on a train with her two boys Keiko tells Minoru that they're going to meet someone who wants to see him. Minoru asks, \"Who? Daddy?\" She answers, \"Well, yes.\"<ref namehttp://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~p-g/data/2004/040910/torareta.htm|title2010-07-19|languageP.G. Web Site}}\n"}
