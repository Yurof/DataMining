Julieta, his mother, is unconcerned, believing that when Thom\u00e1s is ready and wants to open his eyes, he will. These events instill a strong belief in free will in young Thom\u00e1s. One day, seemingly out of nowhere, Thom\u00e1s opens his eyes, apparently to look directly at his five-year-old brother Francisco. * 1992 - Julieta is a wife and a loving mother, working in a hospital emergency department. Her free-spirited youngest son, Thom\u00e1s, is the product of her marriage to her second husband Alexandre. Pedro, her first husband and father of her eldest son Francisco, lives in Argentina. Pedro and Julieta remain good friends. During childhood, Francisco and Thom\u00e1s are very close, perhaps too close according to Pedro, with whom they spend a summer in Buenos Aires. * 2008 - Years later, when Francisco is 27 and Thom\u00e1s 22, Julieta dies. The brothers become lovers and an unusual love story ensues.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440741/\n"}
