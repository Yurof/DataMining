{"wikiId": "23245328", "titre": "Missing Lynx", "dateSortie": "2008", "duree": "102.0", "genre": ["Family Film", "Comedy", "Animation"], "resume": "F\u00e9lix, a clumsy and unlucky Iberian lynx, is staying at the animal recovery center at the Do\u00f1ana National Park, after one of his countless mishaps. When they arrive, however, the national park had undergone security measures while Felix was gone. It is then revealed that mysterious animal kidnappings have occurred throughout national parks, which had caused Felix's national park to be turned into a prison-like structure. In the dead of night, the center is attacked by mercenaries led by Newmann, the self-titled \"greatest hunter in the world\", hired by an eccentric millionaire, No\u00e9 , who intends to create a sort of Noah's Ark for threatened species. Assisted by his friends - Gus, a paranoid chameleon; Beeea , a daredevil goat; Astart\u00e9, a brave falcon; and Rupert, a poor-sighted mole - F\u00e9lix  must foil No\u00e9's plans. They avoid Newmann's forces as they guide themselves to Noah's ship. There, Newmann, having just forced Noah to give him control of the ship, attempts to kill Felix, but unexpected events leads to the ship sinking, with Newmann seemingly dying. Afterwards, Felix and Lincesa  have a baby, and Felix comes upon two people who argue about something before taking Felix to the refuge. The film then ends. In a post-credits scene, it is shown that Newmann actually survived his encounter at the ship, but now has a fear of cats. All of the movie takes place in the natural parks of Andalusia. The film was developed using IBM's servers.\n"}
