Simbhu\u2019s grandmother \u2013 slays five men, mind you when she was only ten, since they flouted her father\u2019s advices and distilled alcohol illegally in the village also involving in other shady activities. The villagers, for her noble act, consider her their head after her return from the prison and are peaceful under her reign. However, trouble crops up in the name of a police officer \u2013 Lal \u2013 whose ego is hurt when challenged by the fellow policeman\u2019s son that he can\u2019t find anything illicit in Simbhu\u2019s village, ruled by the godmother Seema. Lal tries - but to no avail - to nail somebody from the village for any charges and ends being thrashed up the villagers. Predictably, he returns with a vengeance and in the dirty war, burns Seema alive. Enough reason for Simbhu to seek retribution for his loss. Simbhu returns to Chennai, uses the tried and tested formula to woo Lal\u2019s daughter Vedhika, and after a couple of duets abducts her as a hostage on revenge of his grandmother\n"}
