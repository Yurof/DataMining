When he's fired from the newspaper where he\u2019s worked for fifteen years, his friend Phil  quits too, outraged. Together, they work from their \u201coffice\u201d, on a park bench, until Phil can get Ellery a try-out, on a radio spot, as \u201cUncle Dudley\u201d. The character is a big hit, with his folksy witticisms. Meanwhile, at home, Ma, Mrs. Cushing , has her hands full with their daughter, Ruth , who has spurned Phil\u2019s attentions for an aging Lothario, Jerry . While their oldest son, Robert , after turning down a job, has got mixed up with some \u201cRed\u201d rabble-rousers, in the park. Only their youngest son, Tommy , manages to stay out of trouble, doing his homework. Tommy thinks their Dad is alright, even better than \u201cthat guy on the radio\u201d, who they don\u2019t know is their father. It\u2019s only after \u201cUncle Dudley\u201d gets a concussion, after being hit with a brick, quelling a riot of \u201cReds\u201d, in the park that his family begin to value his worth, and, Phil\u2019s, if they all live to appreciate it.\n"}
