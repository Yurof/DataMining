Captain Victor Benezet  questions Henry Hearst, an upstanding lawyer  about the crime, turning a ten-minute interview into a grueling interrogation. Hearst has a strained relationship with his beautiful young wife Chantal Hearst . A wealthy, influential man, Hearst has become the prime suspect, but the evidence against him is circumstantial. As the city celebrates the San Sebastian Festival, the police captain brings in Hearst for questioning, at first politely, and then less so, as he and a younger detective chip away at the suspect's alibi. They interrogate him for hours while Hearst's most private secrets are exposed one by one.\n"}
