A 7-year-old child was first seen running on a vast field to scare the crows off of the meadows of Thessalonica, and then he falls from a tree while reaching out to a nightingale. Everything goes black. The child who falls from the tree is Mustafa, who would have grown to become the founder of the Turkish Republic and be given the surname Atat\u00fcrk, that is, if he did not fall to his \"death\" that day. The film fast-forwards to over a century later, to the year 2007. There is no savior named Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in Turkey\u2019s history, no War of Independence has been fought, Ankara has not become the country\u2019s capital and the country continues its existence as the Ottoman Republic, ruled by the Sultan Osman VII , who has become little more than a figurehead and a source of ridicule by foreign dignitaries.\n"}
