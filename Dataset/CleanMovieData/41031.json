Her 'alone time' is fractured by a police detective, Vincent, who feels he might have one hell of a case on his hands. His suspect; twenty something, attractive, covered in blood, protecting a nondescript package, sits in his interrogation room, unwilling to divulge information pertinent to the case at hand.
