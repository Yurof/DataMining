She chooses Kashmir and, upon arrival, rents a houseboat from the owner, Raja. After a few misunderstandings, they are attracted to each other and soon fall in love. This romance is not looked upon favorably by Raj Bahadur Chunilal, Rita's dad, as he would prefer his daughter marry a suitor he has chosen for her: Kishore.
