Manchurian General Che Kang  is a clever Warlord who capitalizes on the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Fong Sai Yuk. Neither man realizes that they fight for the Shaolin cause, and General Che Kang tricks Fong Sai Yuk into believing that Hung Si Kuan is a renegade bandit. With the help of the General\u2019s henchmen, Fong Sai Yuk defeats a bloodied Hung Si Kuan. Then the tough rebel is put into shackles inside the General\u2019s castle. Word quickly spreads that Fong Sai Yuk beat the unbeatable Shaolin hero, and the local faction of the rebellion attacks the unknowing Fong Sai Yuk for his rash actions. When the rebel leader reveals the true nature of Hung Si Kuan, Fong Sai Yuk is beside himself. The na\u00efve martial artist initially intends to correct his mistake by sneaking into the General\u2019s dungeon and liberating his cohort from the grasp of the Manchurians. However, General Che Kang himself is a powerful Kung Fu practitioner who foils Fong Sai Yuk\u2019s plans. Once Fong Sai Yuk joins his Rebel brothers, they devise a plan to tunnel into the underground prison and rescue Hung Si Kuan. After several tenuous attempts at freeing him, the Shaolin heroes succeed in their task. Now reunited, Fong Sai Yuk, Hung Si Kuan, and their Rebel brothers must endure the assault of General Che Kang and his Manchurian army.\n"}
