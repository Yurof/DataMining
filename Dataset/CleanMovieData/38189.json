She feels that her life is empty and artificial. She is a traveling cosmetic saleswoman, setting up \"Pink Lady\" training seminars in the western portion of the United States. When she is asked if she's \"one of those Mary Kaye ladies?\", she replies, \"No, we're pink, they're more salmon.\" While she is popular and successful selling \"Pink Lady,\" there is nothing real or honest in her life. As Harmony travels around the country, trying to figure out what is missing from her life, Elvis impersonators keep dying in her wake. She is romantically pursued by Miles .\n"}
