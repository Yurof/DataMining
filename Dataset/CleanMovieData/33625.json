One of his students describes him as \"a freak who thinks he's living in the fourteenth century\". and eventually gives Suba a chance to teach, assigning him the beginning students. While Villard takes a ruthless approach, encouraging a student to injure an opponent to win, Suba takes a more subtle approach, encouraging students to turn their own weaknesses into strength. Following this advice, one of Suba's beginning level students scores against Villard's prize fencer during an in-school competition. Flashbacks further develop the conflict by revealing how Suba had killed Villard's father in a fencing duel. The film climaxes in a dramatic duel between Villard and Suba.\n"}
