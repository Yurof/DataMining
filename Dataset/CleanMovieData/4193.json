Only every now and then her mother visits her daughter but during these occasions it occurs to her that her daughter could be a potential model. She starts exploiting her daughter who by transforming into a kind of Lolita becomes increasingly alienated from other children of her age. Then Mamie dies and Hannah's photographs are about to unequivocally overstep the line of acceptability. Eventually Hanna's right of custody for her twelve-year-old daughter is at stake. \n"}
