B\u00f6sel is fond of beer and occasionally ill-behaved, while Fellner is more intellectual and refined, constantly asking his colleague Trivial Pursuit questions. However, they gradually bond as they travel around Austria. Later in the film, Fellner is taken ill and is diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer. B\u00f6sel helps Fellner fulfil his last wishes, which include playing on an organ and going into the woods one last time to hear the birds. Fellner dies in his friend's arms, but the film ends optimistically when B\u00f6sel meets an Indian man who seems to be the reincarnation of his friend.\n"}
