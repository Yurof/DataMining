As she takes over the management of their lives, she gradually usurps the privileges of her brother in law, and his children. She acts as a wife mother figure, but does not accept the sexual commitments or maternal responsibilities of her new role. Ramiro, her brother in law, is attracted to Tula as she dotes on his children, but she spurns his affections. She is also critical of his interest in other women. As Ramiros\u2019 sexual frustration grows, he attempts to rape Tula. Tula\u2019s priest advises her to marry Ramiro. When she is ready to agree, she discovers that Ramiro is paying court to another woman, Tula\u2019s nubile teenage cousin, Juanita and obtaining sexual favors elsewhere. Juanita becomes pregnant and Ramiro is forced to marry her, taking his children and new wife to a life, out of the provinces and into the city. The closing scene shows Tula waving goodbye to the m\u00e9nage as the train departs, resigned to her spinster status.\n"}
