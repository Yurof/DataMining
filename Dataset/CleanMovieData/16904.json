Maria is the female reincarnation of Jesus, representing the strength of the Sartanejo women. She invites the Beatas  on a mission of prayer for which they journey through the countryside, witnessing social unrest among the population. Maria meets the hero of the peasants, the strong worker Antero whose history intermingles with hers. Through mythical dreams, visions, and stories heard along their journey, we witness the unfolding of Biblical prophecy in which Old Testament texts mingle with the folktales of the Sert\u00e3o. The film aims to show how people try to find strength in myths, art, and religion when faced with the harsh realities of life.\n"}
