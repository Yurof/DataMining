Madden teams up with Filipino resistance fighters to liberate POW's from Cabanatuan. One of his officers, Captain Andr\u00e9s Bonif\u00e1cio , carries a heavy burden. Not only does he have to live up to being the grandson of Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio a national hero, but his former fianc\u00e9e Dalisay Delgado  is apparently collaborating with the Japanese, broadcasting propaganda over the radio.\n"}
