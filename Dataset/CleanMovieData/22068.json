She\u2019s so troubled that she can\u2019t work, and her relationship with Mangi, her 13-year-old deaf daughter, goes from bad to worse. One day Me\u2019Tau, an elderly woman, arrives at the newspaper\u2019s office. Ten years earlier, Thandeka witnessed the murder of Me\u2019Tau\u2019s daughter, Dineo, by the secret police. Me\u2019Tau wants Thandeka to find the murderers and Dineo\u2019s body so that the girl can be buried in accordance with tradition. What Me\u2019Tau couldn\u2019t know is that Thandeka has already paid for her knowledge, for having dared stand up to the apartheid system run by the whites. Meanwhile, Mangi secretly prepares a Zulu love letter, four embroidered images representing solitude, loss, hope, and love, as a final gesture towards her mother so that she won\u2019t give up the fight.\n"}
