{"wikiId": "4474435", "titre": "El padrecito", "dateSortie": "1964", "duree": "130.0", "genre": ["Religious Film", "Comedy", "World cinema"], "resume": "The young priest Father Sebasti\u00e1n  is assigned to a parish in San Jer\u00f3nimo el Alto, where he is not welcomed by the community, particularly the resident priest Father Dami\u00e1n . The newcomer gradually earns the trust of the people through humor, but firmly captures their hearts by saving the town fiesta by fighting a bull when the hired torero failed to show. Father Sebasti\u00e1n counsels the townspeople, lecturing them on their duties in a modern society. He used the collection plate to redistribute the town's wealth more evenly. When accused of communism, he quoted the 1891 socially-conscious encyclical Rerum Novarum. He even ventured into politics, with a veiled attack on the municipal president couched into a sermon. Eventually, he brokers a deal with the local political boss for some concessions for the poor of his parish.\n"}
