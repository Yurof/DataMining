In 1794, in Marseille, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary  makes the acquaintance of a Corsican named Joseph Bonaparte  and invites him and his brother, Gen. Napoleon Bonaparte , to call upon the family the following day. The next day, Julie , D\u00e9sir\u00e9e's sister and Joseph are immediately attracted to each other, and Napoleon is taken with D\u00e9sir\u00e9e. He admits to her that the poor Bonaparte brothers need the rich dowries of the Clary sisters. Later, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e learns that Napoleon has been arrested and taken to Paris. Napoleon eventually returns to Marseille, tells D\u00e9sir\u00e9e that he has been cleared of all charges, but has been ordered to track down royalists in Paris. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e begs Napoleon to leave the Army and join her brother in business, but he scoffs at the idea and instead proposes marriage. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e accepts and lends Napoleon the money to return to Paris. Napoleon tells her that he will always love her and will return soon for their wedding but, as the months pass, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e begins to doubt him and goes to the city where she meets General Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte . She learns that Napoleon is engaged to the wealthy, Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais . D\u00e9sir\u00e9e contemplates suicide, but she is stopped by Bernadotte who falls in love with her. Later, in 1797, Napoleon, now France\u2019s leading general, has succeeded in conquering Italy, and D\u00e9sir\u00e9e lives in Rome with Julie and Joseph. She soon tires of Rome, however, and decides to return to Paris, where she meets Napoleon, now married to Josephine, who announces that he will be leaving for Egypt. Bernadotte is thrilled to see D\u00e9sir\u00e9e again and proposes marriage to her. By July 4, 1799, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e and Bernadotte have happily settled into married life and have a son, Oskar. On November 9, 1799, Napoleon is proclaimed First Consul of the French Republic and asks Bernadotte to join his council of state. Bernadotte agrees. Several years later, Napoleon is proclaimed emperor, and at his coronation he takes the crown from the hands of Pope Pius VII and crowns himself. Five years later, desperate for an heir, Napoleon divorces Josephine, and D\u00e9sir\u00e9e comforts her former rival, before Napoleon\u2019s upcoming marriage to the eighteen-year-old Marie Louise of Austria . Napoleon involves France in more wars, and Bernadotte is approached by representatives of the king of Sweden, who wishes to adopt him and make him the heir to the throne. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, stunned by the news that she will one day be a queen, nevertheless supports her husband, and eventually Napoleon allows both of them to leave Paris. In Stockholm, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e does not fit in with the royal family and asks to go home. Eight months later, she attends a ball in Paris at which Napoleon shows off his new son. Napoleon makes veiled threats about Bernadotte\u2019s alliance with Russia and announces to the crowd that she will be held hostage to ensure Sweden\u2019s support while his army marches through Russia to Moscow. Napoleon\u2019s army is defeated and he visits D\u00e9sir\u00e9e and asks her to write a letter to Bernadotte, requesting his help. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e realizes that Napoleon still loves her and came more for her than to seek her husband\u2019s help. Soon after, Bernadotte leads one of the armies that overwhelms Napoleon, and the triumphant general reunites with D\u00e9sir\u00e9e before returning to Sweden. Napoleon\u2019s exile to Elba is short-lived, however, and after the battle of Waterloo, Napoleon retreats with his personal army to the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison. Representatives of the allied armies ask D\u00e9sir\u00e9e to speak with Napoleon, hoping that she can persuade him to surrender. Napoleon agrees to speak with D\u00e9sir\u00e9e alone, and muses on what his destiny would have been if he had married her. Napoleon proclaims that he has given his life to protect France, but D\u00e9sir\u00e9e gently tells him that he must do as France asks and go into exile on St. Helena. Commenting on how strange it is that the two most outstanding men of their time had fallen in love with her, Napoleon gives D\u00e9sir\u00e9e his sword in surrender, and assures her that her dowry was not the only reason he proposed to her many years ago in Marseille.\n"}
