Seventeen years ago the Erigarays left Argentina and moved to Spain to live a peaceful and quiet life. However, things change rather abruptly when a famous Argentinian writer named Bruno Leardi  claims that M\u00f3nica is in reality his granddaughter named Diana, daughter of his son Diego Liardi who disappeared during the Dirty War in Argentina. At one point in the film Ernesto Erigaray and his cohorts accost Bruno and make it clear that harm will come to him if he persists with his accusations and attempts to see M\u00f3nica. Erigaray decides to confront Bruno in his hotel room, but nothing is settled. The family ends up in a Court approved hearing and Ernesto Erigaray is accused of being the Argentine torturer known by his men as \"El Sapo\"  who did his nasty work in a place known as \"the Cesspit.\" Subsequently, DNA tests prove that M\u00f3nica is indeed the daughter of Diego Liardi and Sara Pereira . M\u00f3nica leaves the Erigaray's and they are arrested and tried for the murder of a Spanish citizen and M\u00f3nica's illegal abduction. One year later M\u00f3nica travels to Buenos Aires and marches with the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. She drops by her grandfather's home and tells him Diana has come to call on him. The film ends with the dedication: :To the mothers and grandmothers of Plaza del Mayo, and to those who resist the abduction of our memories.\n"}
