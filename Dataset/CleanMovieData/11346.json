Since her husband does not work, devoting himself exclusively to studies with the intention of becoming a new genius of chemistry, Roswitha has to support her family by running an illegal abortion clinic. Facing the indifference of her husband, who believes that she is intellectually inferior, the open hostility of doctors like Dr. Gen\u00e9e  and a harsh double journey, Roswitha receives a hard blow when her clinic is closed by police. From then on, she puts aside her passivity and begins a journey to redefine herself as mother, wife and working woman, part of a society threatened by an early globalization.\n"}
