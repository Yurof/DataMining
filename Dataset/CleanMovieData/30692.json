He goes to work for Mr. Els . He tries to persuade financier Mr. Taggart  to fund the development of his inventions, but Taggart has no interest in financing \u201cgreen electrical workers\u201d. However, General Powell , the president of Western Union, does. Edison eventually sells an invention to Taggart and Powell for $40,000, enabling him to get married and open his own \u201cinvention factory\u201d at Menlo Park. In the next few years, he perfects the phonograph with his devoted staff. Trouble arises when Bunt brags to reporters that Edison has invented the electric light. Since he hasn't yet, he is condemned by the scientific community . Edison \u201cleaves science behind\u201d, and with a Herculean trial-and-error effort, finally succeeds in inventing a practical electric light. His subsequent plans to light New York are again hindered by Taggart, who arranges it so that Edison is only given six months to complete the entire task. Nevertheless, Edison finishes the job just in time.\n"}
