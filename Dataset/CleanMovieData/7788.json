To his horror, He\u0159man discovers that he is to treat Adolf Hitler, whose suicide in 1945 was faked. Hitler now lives in an isolated sanatorium in Germany, surrounded by his ostensibly loyal followers, a group of former high-ranking Nazis. But those men blame him for Germany's defeat and destruction, and have decided that a single death is not satisfactory punishment for Hitler. Rather, he is made to believe that the Second World War is still being fought. The German officers stage 'Allied raids' in which Hitler is captured, faces trial and a death sentence, put under the guillotine's blade and then is rescued by his supporters at the last moment - only to face it all again, over and over. The experience drives Hitler into an unberable mental agony; The doctor decides to put an end to his misery and kills him.\n"}
