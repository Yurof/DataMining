Nico is always followed by a black cat. The following morning, the cat wakes in a house with a little girl, catches a lizard and gives it to the girl. Zo\u00e9, hearing Jeanne, her mother, calls her to come in and look at her lizards, but Jeanne is too busy on the phone to take much notice of what she is shown. At nightfall, the cat leaves and goes to find Nico. On the way the cat walks on walls and teases a dog that barks incessantly causing its owner to throw a shoe at it. Nico gives the cat a bracelet in the shape of fish, which it gives to Zo\u00e9. Her mother sees the bracelet and asks Zo\u00e9 to give it to her. Before leaving, Zo\u00e9 sees a picture in her mother's dossier file of a man Victor Costa. Jeanne takes the bracelet and gives it to Lucas, a colleague of hers at the police station who asks her to see if it matches up to any of the items stolen at one the most recent burglaries in the Rue Mouffetard. Jeanne is commissioned to handle the security of a huge African statue that has been the target of M. Costa and that cost her husband his life. The statue is being moved soon and will be the last opportunity for Costa to get his hands on it. Victor Costa has been indeed planning how to steal the statue with his minions, M. B\u00e9b\u00e9 , M. Hulot, M. Grenouille , M. Patate . When the bracelet does indeed turn up, Lucas follows the lead up to Nico's. Claudine has been watching Zo\u00e9, but fails to notice that she has followed the cat. While following the cat Zo\u00e9 discovers that Claudine is actually a member of his gang and has been working as a sitter to have a deep insight into what the police are planning. The thieves discover Zo\u00e9 who hides in Nico\u2019s house, M. Costa nearly discovers Zo\u00e9 but at the last minute one of his minions calls for him down to the cellar, they have discovered Nico\u2019s cache. Zo\u00e9 tries to leave but she is caught by Claudine but at the last minute Nico comes back, who locks the mobsters in the cellar. Nico escapes with Zo\u00e9 on his back jumping over the roof tops with M. Costa and his gang in pursuit after they broke the door down. Nico leaves Zo\u00e9 near the zoo, she must follow the cat back to his place while he distracts the thieves. The gang is close by and they all follow Nico but M. Costa discovers a piece of Zo\u00e9\u2019s t-shirt in the bushes and orders M. Grenouille to follow him after the child in the zoo where they come close to catching her but she escapes in a boat and due to the fact that neither M. Costa nor M. Grenouille can swim. Lucas has been following the cat lead and a neighbor tells him that the cat always comes out of a neighboring house and goes to another, annoying everyone because of the dog. Lucas calls Jeanne to come to her own house because it is related to the burglaries. After she arrives they head up to Nico\u2019s to wait. After shaking the rest of the gang, Nico goes back to his place and finds Zo\u00e9 there, as he is about to enter the house he is arrested by Jeanne and Lucas, Claudine tells Jeanne that Nico kidnapped Zo\u00e9. Jeanne and Lucas take Nico in their police car and while driving to the station, Nico tells Jeanne that she made a mistake and that Zo\u00e9 is in great danger, he gets the cat to attack Lucas who is driving and uses the opportunity to grab Jeanne\u2019s gun and take over the situation, after stopping he tells Jeanne that he is going to stop Costa and save Zo\u00e9. Jeanne becomes suspicious and orders Lucas to take her home. As they arrive they see that indeed Zo\u00e9 and Claudine are not there. Claudine has taken Zo\u00e9 to M. Costa\u2019s house and they have her locked in one of the rooms while drinking champagne. Claudine applies more of her usual perfume that makes everyone else sick, they open the window and the scent reaches Nico and the cat, who always sneezes at Claudine\u2019s smell and it leads Nico to Zo\u00e9. After cutting the power down he puts on his usual night goggles and sneaks into the house and whisks Zo\u00e9 away right under the nose of M. Patate who is sulking because he is stuck with the child and not drinking champagne with the rest of the gang. At the last moment Nico\u2019s presence is discovered and once again he escapes with Zo\u00e9 over the roof tops with M. Costa in pursuit. The chase takes them up to Notre Dame de Paris, Nico leaves Zo\u00e9 in one of the terraces and teases Costa to go after him, they both fall because the gargoyles cannot take their weight but Costa is saved because he grabs another gargoyle while Nico is saved by Jeanne. Costa manages to trap Zo\u00e9 again and jumps over to a nearby crane followed by Jeanne, Nico and the cat. Costa manages to push the cat over the edge and Nico jumps to save it, leaving Jeanne to confront Costa by herself; Jeanne has been having waking nightmares about Costa but she rises above them and uses her personal defense training to free Zo\u00e9 and disorient Costa who falls from the crane. Jeanne tries to save Costa with the help of Nico, by grabbing him by his shirt; Costa has banged his head against the crane very hard and becomes mad and has a hallucination that the statue has come to rescue him so he jumps off the crane\u2019s hook into the hands of the statue, falling to his death. The rest of the gang, including Claudine, are arrested and Zo\u00e9 has now started talking again. The next winter, the cat goes over to Nico\u2019s but is let in by Jeanne, from the window it can be seen that Jeanne, Zo\u00e9 and Nico are a new family. Nico gives a gift to Jeanne, a snow globe with Notre Dame in it.\n"}
