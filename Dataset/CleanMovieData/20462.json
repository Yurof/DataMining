Worshipped by the Saharaui in exile, Mariem Hassan inspires hope to those who still live in the territories occupied by Morocco. An intelligent woman with an awe-inspiring voice, she has managed to take traditional Saharaui music to the 21st century. The documentary records the many ups and downs of Mariem's life. It reveals her as a \"courageous and enduring character who has become one of the most charismatic and respected singers of the world music scene\". To make the documentary, director Manuel Dominguez accompanied Mariem Hassan on her travels with a camera, selecting from all of her concerts and recordings. His narrative captures the excitement of each \"agarit\" . We see her at the ETNOSOI Festival in Helsinki in 2004, in Les Escales, France, where the concert was transformed into a party with the Tuareg groups that joined the performance, in a theater in Li\u00e8ge singing \"Do not abandon me,\" two days before enduring an operation for cancer, and in recordings made in the desert in Saharawi camps.\n"}
