The father predicates order and restraint, which enhance his own power under the mantle of family love. The son seeks freedom and ecstasy, challengingly signified, in the film, through his incestuous passion for his sister Ana . When the son leaves home on the farm and moves to a seedy boarding house, his older brother Pedro , is asked by their mother  to bring him back. His return, however, will completely shatter the family's confining life.\n"}
