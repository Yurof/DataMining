She has been an orphan from the age of eight, her father having killed her mother for suspected infidelity, and then killed himself when her infidelity was proved untrue. She picks up men to have short sex flings, but no longer believes in love, having hurt her former boyfriend, Jacques, whom she occasionally contacts out of loneliness, but who is never available at the same time as her. An unkempt younger man, Antoine, sees her at a cafe as she is being dumped by her latest fling, and falls in love with her. He stands outside the beauty shop to watch for Ang\u00e8le, follows her to a caf\u00e9 and declares his love for her, but she for once is lost for words and does not immediately return his feelings. Antoine also reveals that despite his feelings for her, he is engaged, but feels he is drifting away from his fianc\u00e9e. However, despite her refusal to believe in love, Ang\u00e8le gradually falls for Antoine. Venus Beauty Institute is run by Nadine, and Ang\u00e8le's co-workers include Samantha, who has a string of dates and gives Ang\u00e8le their descriptions, and Marie, the youngest who is still learning the ropes. The co-workers' love lives contrast with Ang\u00e8le's. Marie has as her client an aging pilot, who had been burnt and had his face reconstructed from his late wife's skin. The pilot wants Marie to come to his house, which she eventually does, watched by Ang\u00e8le and Antoine. Ang\u00e8le is concerned that Marie is too na\u00efve and that the pilot invited her to his house to seduce her. As Marie and the pilot begin to make love, Ang\u00e8le and Antoine start kissing. Christmas is approaching, and Ang\u00e8le goes to her aunts in Poitiers. Antoine had revealed that he is a sculptor, and had been commissioned to do an altarpiece for the cathedral there. She goes the cathedral to see the artwork, but changes her mind when an old friend recognizes her. Returning to Paris, Ang\u00e8le goes to the hospital to visit Samantha, who tried to commit suicide out of loneliness over Christmas. Samantha reveals that Nadine is starting a new store, and that she found a new girl to temporarily replace Samantha. However, the new girl, Evelyne, turns out to be a disaster, wanting to arrange the products by colour rather than function, and eventually quits. Meanwhile, Antoine's fianc\u00e9e had followed him and seen him leave the store with Ang\u00e8le. She goes to the store as a client, and confides to Ang\u00e8le that her fianc\u00e9 is seeing someone else, but she thinks he still loves her. Later, when Antoine takes Ang\u00e8le shopping, Antoine's fianc\u00e9e comes into the store; Ang\u00e8le sees them together and thinks Antoine has betrayed her. She phones Antoine to tell her call their relationship off. To make amends, as Ang\u00e8le is left to close the store on New Year's Eve, Antoine comes to the store with a present. It is a new dress. Antoine's fianc\u00e9e sees this and comes into the store with a gun, but when she fires all she succeeds in hitting is the lights. As the sparks fly, Antoine and Ang\u00e8le kiss each other.\n"}
