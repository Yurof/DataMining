He moves\u2014rather improbably, given his conservative nature\u2014into a building inhabited by various punky misfits  wrestling with their cultural and religious identity. Or, as red-mohawked guitarist Jehangir  puts it, their \"mismatching of disenfranchised subcultures.\" Others include ever-shirtless skateboarding wild man Amazing Ayyub , spike-haired stoner Fasiq  and brawny, glowering Umar , the would-be moral enforcer in a houseful of rebels against Koranic strictures. Sole female in residence is Rabeya , who wears a head-to-toe burka yet is full of ideas that might be considered blasphemous.\n"}
