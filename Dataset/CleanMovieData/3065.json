After capturing slaves with the complicity of an African chief , he then starts his voyage for Cuba. Along with the slaves below-deck, the passengers include his mistress, the slave Aich\u00e9 , and the ship's doctor, Doctor Corot . Tamango , one of the captured men, plans a revolt and tries to persuade Aich\u00e9 to join him and the other slaves. When the captured slaves do rebel, Tamango manages to hold Aich\u00e9 hostage. A deadlock between the two sides then develops and Captain Renker states he will fire a cannon into the ships' hold and kill all the slaves unless they give up. Aich\u00e9 is given a chance to leave by Tamango but after looking up the ladder that leads out of the hold , chooses to stay with her fellow slaves. The captain makes good on his threat and shoots the cannon into the hold, literally silencing the slaves' songs.Miller, pages\u00a0224, 231, 233\n"}
