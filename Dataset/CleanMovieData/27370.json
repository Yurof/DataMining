The drill, a fully American project, is powerful enough to drill through solid rock at a fast pace and is used to try and rescue the team from their fate. The operation begins, but the drill accidentally breaks through the Earth's crust and into the very centre of the Earth, where the operators encounter hidden dangers awaiting them at the Earth's core, and must battle prehistoric creatures in order to save both the research team and themselves and to try and return to the surface of the Earth before it is too late.\n"}
