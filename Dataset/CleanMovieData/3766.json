With her braided hair and traditional clothes, she is the laughingstock of her fellow students who strive to look European, adopting wigs and European clothing. The film tells of the depersonalization of young Africans when they enter into contact with the European culture. In this sense, the film fits into the \"authenticity policy\" of Mobutu.<ref nameLe cin\u00e9ma du congo D\u00e9mocratique | author2008 | isbnhttp://books.google.ca/books?idPA40&dqen&sa-jBeT_3NO-jm0QHmt5SECg&vedonepage&qfalse | chapter37-40|language12 March 2012}}\n"}
