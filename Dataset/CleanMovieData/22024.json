Palast introduces George W. Bush with particular reference to his popular image as a war hero cemented in the public mind by his landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln for the 2003 Mission Accomplished Speech. However Palast alleges that Bush used his father\u2019s influence to gain a draft-dodging placement with the Texas Air National Guard which he subsequently failed to serve.  Palast picks up the story with Bush\u2019s 2000 US Presidential Election campaign where he claims Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris used their influence to purge and discount the ballots of predominantly Gore-supporting black voters through the \u201cfake felons list\u201d compiled by private company DBT/ChoicePoint for US$4 million.  Palast goes on to examine the corporate donors to Bush\u2019s election campaign, such as Enron CEO Ken Lay, who as members of Bush\u2019s pioneer network contributed huge sums through family and friends, and who he claims subsequently profited from the Bush presidency with senior government appointments, no-bid contracts, executive orders and deregulation.  Palast outlines what he refers to as the Bush-cycle, where Bush family members use money to gain political office and then use the office to gain even more money, dating back to Senator Prescott Bush who funded the family\u2019s entry into the oil business, citing the example of Bush\u2019s Harken Energy winning a contract to drill in the Persian Gulf thanks he alleges to Bush Snr\u2019s presidency.  Palast alleges that both prior to and since the September 11 attacks Bush has blocked investigations into members of the Bin Laden family and other rich Saudis, who are alleged to have provided funding to Al Qaeda and which have long been funnelling money into Bush family business ventures via businessman James R. Bath, who was a part owner of Bush\u2019s failed Arbusto Energy.  Palast concludes with Bush\u2019s declaration of the Iraq War, which he claims was made to fulfil a long planned strategy, drawn up at the beginning of Bush\u2019s presidency, to divide and sell up all of Iraq\u2019s assets, especially the oil, to the Bush family\u2019s corporate donors against the interests of the Iraqi people and their democratic ambitions.\n"}
