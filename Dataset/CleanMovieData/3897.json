{"wikiId": "34415528", "titre": "Caf\u00e9 de flore", "dateSortie": "2011-09-02", "duree": "120.0", "genre": ["Romance Film", "Drama"], "resume": "The film cuts between two seemingly unrelated stories. One, set in present-day Montreal, stars Kevin Parent as Antoine, a successful club DJ torn between his new girlfriend Rose  and his still-complicated relationship with his ex-wife Carole ; the other, set in 1960s Paris, stars Vanessa Paradis as Jacqueline, the fiercely protective single mother of Laurent , a child with Down syndrome who has a crush on V\u00e9ro , a friend and companion who also has Down syndrome. The film builds toward the revelation of how the two stories are linked: after Jacqueline, Laurent, and V\u00e9ro are killed in a car accident, Carole, Antoine, and Rose are their subsequent reincarnations.\n"}
