After firstly being booked for a geriatrics evening entertainment with Ritchie saying \u201cHow was I supposed to know the bloke just asked if we were a '60s disco\u201d. Then getting their first proper gig \u2026no not a posh house party in a willow mansion but a wedding reception in a Kirby pub\u2026Ritchie retorts \u201cKIRBY? Bloody ell it will cost us \u00a341 in life insurance c\u2019mon man Kirby is bad news wedding receptions worse news a wedding reception in Kirby is a disaster! There\u2019s always some knob head going through your records and there\u2019s always a fight\u201d Still the pair turn up and as Ritchie predicts it kicks off big style so they make their getaway \u2026Quick only to find the van break dow. Ritchie then introduces john to Keck\u2019s  a British Rail buffet car attendant with high ambitions who sold the van to Ritchie after a quick drink and a French revolution Keck\u2019s tells them to \u201ctake it to our kids in the morning and he will fix it free of charge\u201d Then offers them a bit of work moving some gear from his lock up. The following night Ritchie and John arrive outside Keck\u2019s lockup to find a strange noise coming from within\u201dwhat\u2019s he doing in there drilling for oil?\u201d Ritchie queries. Keck\u2019s appears with a number off parcels which they load into the van and take to Keck\u2019s flat when they arrive Keck\u2019s tells the lads to go on he will lock up the van but sneakily hides a parcel in the freezer compartment. When the parcels are safely in Keck\u2019s flat he gives the lads \u00a320 and says \u201cerrr and if anything else goes wrong with the van! Tough shit \u201cand closes the door. Ritchie and John head for the nearest pub and commenting how one minute your down and then your up again as they order their beer the bartender notes \u201c and then your right back down again\u201d as he shows the \u00a320 note as an obvious fake. They hurry back to Keck\u2019s flat and arrive just as he is trying to leave with a convincing disguise on \u2026not they force Keck\u2019s to tell the what\u2019s going on and he tells them that he has stole some printing plates for \u00a320 notes of a heavy duty villain in London and is about to skip the country with his little bundle but he\u2019s hidden the plates in the van and was going to ring the lads when he was abroad to ask if the would deliver them to a contact in parkiston. But the bloke won\u2019t be there till later in the week so they would have to sit on the plates \u201cthat\u2019s great that is you piss of out of Liverpool and we have to hang about and listen for cockney accents\u201d Ritchie points out Keck\u2019s replies \u201cyou\u2019re a mobile disco stay mobile after being offered \u00a31000 for delivery and another \u00a31000 on arrival they worryingly agree when Keck\u2019s asks for a lift to the airport they say \u201c not a chance \u201c and leave. As they leave they pass a couple of guys on the stairs who comment about the weather it is not until they get down the stairs they realise they spoke with a cockney accent so they jump in the van and head off coast to coast.\n"}
