Once very successful, he is now in the tenth year of a decade-long string of production failures. His latest play is in the hands of effeminate director Brian Sellars , who is obsessed with Petula Clark; his wife Melanie (Robin Wright  is determined to have a baby; he finds himself bonding with a new neighbor's lonely young daughter  who has mild cerebral palsy; and during one of his middle-of-the-night strolls, he encounters his oddball doppelg\u00e4nger  who claims to be Peter McGowan and develops a friendship of sorts with him.\n"}
