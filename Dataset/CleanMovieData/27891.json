Enragaed, the panther declares himself \"The Pink Avenger\" and goes about gathering an army of snapping turtles. Several mishaps then ensue when the turtles manage to bite the fur trappers repeatedly despite their attempts to capture the panther. After eventually getting caught in their own leg-trap, the pair are then both catapulted by a recoiling tree into the horizon.\n"}
