{"wikiId": "17717339", "titre": "Nuremberg", "dateSortie": "2000", "duree": "", "genre": ["Historical drama", "Docudrama"], "resume": "At the close of World War II, Hermann G\u00f6ring (Brian Cox  surrenders to the Americans and enjoys the hospitality of a U.S. Air Force base. Samuel Rosenman , acting on the orders of U.S. President Harry S. Truman, recruits Justice Robert H. Jackson  to prepare a war crimes tribunal against G\u00f6ring and the surviving Nazi leadership. G\u00f6ring, Albert Speer  and others are arrested for war crimes and imprisoned in a U.S. Army stockade in Bad Mondorf. Jackson, his assistant Elsie Douglas , and his prosecution team fly to Germany. Psychologist Gustave Gilbert  arrives at the stockade with prisoner Hans Frank , who has attempted suicide. Jackson negotiates with Allied representatives Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe , General Iona Nikitchenko  and Henri Donnedieu de Vabres  to ensure a unified prosecution. Jackson selects the Nuremberg Palace of Justice for the site of the trials and reconstruction work commences. G\u00f6ring and the others are stripped of their rank and transferred to the prison in Nuremberg, where they come into conflict with the guards under the command of the strict Colonel Burton C. Andrus . Major Airey Neave  serves G\u00f6ring, Speer and the other with their indictments. U.S. judge Francis Biddle  arrives to take control of the court but reluctantly passes the honour at Jackson\u2019s insistence. Following the suicide of prisoner Robert Ley , round-the-clock watches are posted and Gilbert is appointed prisoner liaison. Sir Geoffrey Lawrence  opens the trial with all defendants pleading not guilty and Jackson gives a stirring opening statement. At lunch a jovial G\u00f6ring holds court over the other defendants while Speer begins to show signs of remorse. Maxwell-Fyfe puts forward an emotive eyewitness account of the Nazis' genocidal policies toward Jews, while Jackson reads out dry documentation. As the court begins to tire of Jackson\u2019s meticulous approach, Maxwell-Fyfe urges pushing on to the witness interviews, which reveal the horrors of the concentration camps. The court is shaken by documentary footage of the camps; even G\u00f6ring appears unsettled.  Speer explains G\u00f6ring\u2019s dominance to Gilbert and insists that his control over the others must be broken. G\u00f6ring takes the stand and begins speaking to the German people. Jackson, at Gilbert\u2019s suggestion, has G\u00f6ring isolated. Under cross-examination, G\u00f6ring outmanoeuvers and humiliates Jackson, who later accuses Biddle of giving G\u00f6ring free rein in court. Douglas talks Jackson out of tendering his resignation, and the two share a kiss. Under advice from Maxwell-Fyfe, Jackson returns to confront G\u00f6ring with evidence of his crimes against the Jews and successfully dismisses the defendant\u2019s denials. At a Christmas party, the housekeeper refuses to serve the Russians, but Douglas rescues the situation before slipping away with Jackson. Gilbert visits the defendants and, under Jackson\u2019s advice, attempts to convince them to take responsibility for their crimes. Andrus relaxes the prison rules for Christmas, and G\u00f6ring shares a friendly drink with his guard, Lt. Tex Wheelis . The cross-examination of the defendants intensifies and the defence calls Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df , who casually reveals the horrors of Auschwitz. Speer is implicated in the enslavement of foreign workers by fellow defendant Fritz Sauckel  and in response accepts collective responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi regime. Gilbert interviews G\u00f6ring\u2019s wife Emmy , who reveals that Hitler had ordered them all executed, which led to the family\u2019s surrender. Jackson is moved by Gilbert\u2019s summation of his examinations \u2014 that the source of the evil behind Nazi Germany was a complete lack of empathy \u2014 to give an impassioned closing statement. G\u00f6ring uses his final statement to condemn the trial, and is sentenced along with 10 others to death by hanging. Speer uses his final statement to commend the tribunal and is sentenced to 20 years in prison. G\u00f6ring commits suicide after his request to be executed by firing squad is denied. Andrus presides over the executions of the others while Jackson and Douglas head home .\n"}
