When his girlfriend, Dixie Donegan, provides words almost by accident, the song is published and is a great success. A few years later, now married and successful songwriters with a hit Broadway show behind them, Dixie realises that Eddie is spending more time in rich New York society than composing. They divorce, but quickly realise they are still in love and can't do without each other. They remarry and write more successful songs, but then Eddie goes off to South America, ostensibly to get inspiration to write a symphony. Dixie again seeks a divorce, but the canny judge refuses to grant it. Eddie returns and they realise that despite all, they're still in love.\n"}
