{"wikiId": "33046736", "titre": "Hypocrites", "dateSortie": "1915-01", "duree": "49.0", "genre": ["Silent film"], "resume": "The film follows the parallel stories of an early Christian ascetic and a modern minister, with most actors in dual roles. Gabriel  is a medieval monk who devotes himself to completing a statue of \u201cTruth,\u201d only to be murdered by a mob when his work turns out to be an image of a naked woman. The contemporary Gabriel is the pastor of a large wealthy urban congregation for whom religion is a matter of appearances, not beliefs. The hypocrisy of the congregation is exposed by a series of vignettes in which the Naked Truth, literally portrayed by a nude Margaret Edwards, reveals their appetites for money, sex and power.\n"}
