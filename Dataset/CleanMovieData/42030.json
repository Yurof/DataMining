A thorn pricks Atat\u00fcrk's finger. The boy asks how a thorn can prick Atat\u00fcrk's hand. Atat\u00fcrk replies with the question: \"can it not prick?\" The boy further asks how Atat\u00fcrk's hand can bleed. Atat\u00fcrk replies with the question: \"can it not bleed?\" Shocked, the boy inquires whether he isn't Atat\u00fcrk? Atat\u00fcrk replies that he is indeed Atat\u00fcrk. The boy, still shocked, replies \"but...\". Atat\u00fcrk interrupts and explains that if one is going to grow a rose, one will suffer pain, one's hand will bleed, sun will make one sweat, there will be people putting to the gardener that the roses in the garden will never die, and that there will be people confronting the gardener on how a rose is supposed to be grown. Atat\u00fcrk continues by saying that the boy should be asking him just one question: \"Do I want to make this place a rose garden? Do I want to grow the world's most beautiful roses in this garden?\" Atat\u00fcrk further adds that if the boy really wishes it to be so, \"he wouldn't care about neither the thorns that prick nor the words said\". Atat\u00fcrk continues by saying that whoever it might be, all he would care about is the scent of the rose garden. Atat\u00fcrk concludes by asking, whether the boy understood the lesson and the boy acknowledges this. The commercial concludes with the statement \"We respectfully commemorate Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, the founder of our country and bank\".\n"}
