He is happy when he gets the opportunity to change his profession to that of trader of silkworm eggs. Because in Europe silkworms are affected by a disease , he is sent to Africa to get healthy eggs.  Since the African silkworms are affected too, he is sent to Japan, even though at that time  almost all of Japan was off-limits to foreigners. The journey is by carriage and train, a caravan of horses through Asia, the boat trip from the Asian continent to Japan, and guided, blindfolded, on horseback to the Japanese village where he can buy the eggs from a local baron, Hara Jubei . During his stay in the village he becomes obsessed with the unnamed concubine of Jubei  who hands him a note in Japanese. On a second journey he has sex with another girl handed to him by Jubei's concubine. Having traded more eggs than on his first trip, Herv\u00e9 delays his departure by two days in the hope of seeing the girl again. At home Herv\u00e9's love remains secret, and though he seems happy with his wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but they remain childless. Herv\u00e9 seeks out a French-Japanese brothel owner in Lyon, Mme Blanche , known for giving the small blue flowers that she wears to her clients, who translates the note for him as: 'Come back or I shall die'. Mme Blanche advises Herv\u00e9 to 'forget about her, she won't die'. The third time he is sent to China, since Japan is no longer safe, and good eggs are now available in China. However, Herv\u00e9 insists in going to Japan anyway. However, when he arrives in Japan war has broken out, and the village is abandoned; Jubei and the girl are not there. A young servant boy of Jubei , who Herv\u00e9 has met before, shows Herv\u00e9 the way to Jubei. The latter becomes hostile and tells Herv\u00e9 to go home. Before he leaves, Herv\u00e9 discovers that Jubei had the boy executed  for showing Herv\u00e9 where to find them. Without meeting the girl Herv\u00e9 buys eggs in China, and returns home. Unfortunately after arrival, Herv\u00e9 discovers that the eggs have hatched and therefore are useless. To employ the village, Herv\u00e9 decides to build H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's garden that disastrous summer. Herv\u00e9 at last receives a long letter from the mysterious concubine, written in Japanese. He again takes the letter Mme Blanche for translation, who agrees, providing Herv\u00e9 never comes to see her again. The letter is a deeply moving declaration of love. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne becomes ill and eventually dies. After her death, Herv\u00e9 finds a tribute of small, blue flowers on her grave. He seeks out Mme Blanche once more, believing her to have written the letter, but Mrs Blanche reveals to him that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had read her the letter to translate into Japanese. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had Mme Blanche translate the letter for her, knowing that her husband was in love with a Japanese woman, and wanting him to be happy. Mme Blanche tells Herv\u00e9 that, more than anything, his wife loved him. Too late, Herv\u00e9 finally realizes that it was H\u00e9l\u00e8ne who was his true love after all. The film ends with Herv\u00e9, fated to remain childless, recounting his story to Ludovic  \u2013 a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 since childhood and now H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's gardener \u2013 on a bench in H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's garden. Henceforth Ludovic can now appreciate the real story behind H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's garden.\n"}
