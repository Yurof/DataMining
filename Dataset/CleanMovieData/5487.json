The kitchen of a Mexican restaurant in Manhattan is getting ready for the noon rush. Nina arrives late for the second day in a row. Manny, the restaurant owner and Jose's brother, fires her. As Nina leaves, Jos\u00e9 follows her outside. She tells him she is pregnant but says she is not ready for a baby and is seriously considering abortion. He takes her to his parents' house and tells her that a few years ago he had been driving a car when he accidentally hit and killed a little girl. He was sentenced to four years in prison. After being released, he tried unsuccessfully multiple times to get in touch with the girl's mother. Jos\u00e9 and Nina have dinner at his parents' house during which Nina finds out that Manny was adopted. Jos\u00e9's parents tell Nina she is always welcome to stay at their house. Jos\u00e9 takes Nina to the beach, which is near the house. Nina tells Jos\u00e9 of how her father's death when she was twelve caused her and her mother severe emotional pain. Since Nina had no siblings and spent her childhood taking care of her emotionally crippled mother, she tells Jos\u00e9 how fortunate he is to have a loving family. The next day, before they each go their own way, Nina says she needs a friend to go with her to the abortion clinic. Jos\u00e9 walks back to the restaurant and reconciles with Manny. Several years later, Jos\u00e9 is playing on a beach with a young girl, Bella, Nina's daughter and Jos\u00e9's adopted daughter. Nina pulls up in a taxi and meets Bella for the first time. The two exchange gifts. The movie ends as Nina, Bella, and Jos\u00e9 walk down the beach together.\n"}
