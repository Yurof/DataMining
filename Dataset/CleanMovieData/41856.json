LaMont, Marcus\u2019s best friend and the only employee of the bar, has everything in order but his music career, and Marcus has everything in order but his ability to speak to women \u2013 yet alone be in relationship with them. But in one wild day at the Mayflower \u2013 everything will change. We begin in the morning, the Mayflower opens to Marcus arriving to hang out with his best friend LaMont. After teasing Marcus about his failed dating past that includes \u201cCrazy Peaches\u201d, Breathalyzer Barbara\u201d, \u201cThat Girl that Cried all the Time\u201d, \u201cDominatrix Donna\u201d, and \u201cVictor\u201d , the owner Chris and Lamont are challenged to a bet by \u201cNo Game\u201d Marcus \u2013 that the next woman through the doors of the Mayflower he\u2019ll go out with. Fortunately for him, it\u2019s not Sasquatch \u2013 it\u2019s the gorgeous Rhonda \u2013 who senses another lame pickup and diffuses it with a quick, crafty lie \u2013 she says she\u2019s a prostitute and would gladly go out with him \u2013 for $1000. Happy with her avoidance tactic, Rhonda flutters away, but Marcus is hooked and gullible, undaunted by her fake profession. The loyal friends decide to support Marcus in getting his dream date \u2013 Chris promises the day\u2019s take at the register if LaMont will get on stage, and soon, the reluctant LaMont agrees to help raise the $1000 for his friend. Added motivation coming after learning his girlfriend is pregnant. Rhonda soon begins to regret her falsity \u2013 Marcus\u2019s genuine sweetness is settling in on her. Her stalker on-again-off-again boyfriend \u201coverhears\u201d her tell her friend this and isn\u2019t very happy. Meanwhile, the boys are in promotion mode \u2013 which means they aren\u2019t doing much at all \u2013 passing out fliers and harassing the town folk. LaMont\u2019s girlfriend has painted the house a few times, demanded sexual acts, cuddling and cried \u2013 a lot \u2013 wearing him down and giving him less certainty about everything, particularly his music. Chris has sidetracked into his own campaign to invent a new drink \u2013 the \u201cMary Poppins\u201d \u2013 and won\u2019t rest until he discovers something strong enough to produce hallucinatory cartoon animals. Soon, Chris is smashed, LaMont is withdrawing into negativity about everything, and Marcus is losing whatever confidence he had. To make financial matters worse, the bar\u2019s only customer is Aaron, a robber who discovers an empty register, sits down to lament over hard times with them all, and ends up spending $5 on a beer. Fortunately, Marcus gets his first concussion of the day when Chris sees a pink Unicorn and accidentally knocks Marcus out in excitement. He awakens on a rooftop in San Francisco, visited by a woman with an umbrella \u2013 not Mary Poppins, but San Francisco\u2019s own Vagina Lady, who sets Marcus back on the right path by reminding him that if he wants the girl, he must \u201cfollow her vagina.\u201d Marcus awakens back at the bar, reborn. He marches to the wax salon , finds Rhonda, and tells her to be at the Bar that night. She agrees, but as Marcus leaves, the stalker confronts him. Concussion #2. LaMont, meanwhile, takes a sip of the prototype \u201cMary Poppins\u201d and is instantly transported to a dark room where he meet\u2019s not Burt, but Dirt, the English chimney sweeper that won\u2019t stop offering LaMont food. LaMont\u2019s last adamant refusal is the same as his first \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not hungry\u201d, and Dirt\u2019s mood grows instantly somber \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s your problem, you\u2019re not hungry.\u201d LaMont is suddenly back at the bar, drink still in hand. He too, is reborn, hungry and ready to Rock the Stage. Chris has done some good among his drunken quest \u2013 he called LaMont\u2019s fans in Modesto, and they pack the bar. Cover alone clears the $1000. All that\u2019s left is for LaMont to rock the house and for Marcus to confront Rhonda. LaMont delivers tremendously, and an undercover record producer that sees him wants to ink a deal. Marcus confronts the woman of his dreams, and when she finds out he still wanted to just go out with her despite thinking he was a prostitute - and that he would pay $1000 to do so, she is overwhelmed with joy. She won\u2019t take the money, but she definitely takes the date \u2013 the first of many. The #2 concussion must have really connected because Marcus forgot about the stalker boyfriend. He came to the show to catch Rhonda in the act. After LaMont's performance he approaches the new couple. But before he can drag Rhonda off he's placed under citizen's arrest by John, the jobless rent-a-cop that everyone hates - until now. John 'drags' the stalker boyfriend off leaving Marcus overjoyed that he didn't have to rescue his damsel in distress.\n"}
