The zombies in this film more closely resemble the creatures of voodoo legend - i.e. the walking dead who do the bidding of a human master - than the flesh-eating living dead ghouls now currently popular. According to the film, the zombies are the preserved bodies of slaves brought to the United States from Guinea.\n"}
