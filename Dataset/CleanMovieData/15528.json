Meanwhile, Zat\u014dichi befriends a local farmer and her gambler nephew and eventually offers his assistance to two geisha siblings  who are seeking revenge for the murder of their parents. The siblings are the only survivors of a massacre that was carried out on their family estate in order to obtain large sums of money ten years ago. They soon discover the people responsible for the murders are the same Yakuza wreaking havoc on the small town. After slicing his way through an army of henchmen with his shikomizue, Zat\u014dichi defeats the Yakuzas' bodyguard, a powerful ronin, in a duel. Zat\u014dichi later wanders into town and confronts the Yakuza bosses, killing the second-in-command and blinding the elderly Yakuza boss  after opening his eyes for the first time and revealing that he has been able to see the entire time. The film ends with a dance number led by noted Japanese tap dance troupe The Stripes, and Zat\u014dichi walking down a trail and tripping over a rock, saying \"Even with my eyes wide open, I can't see anything.\"\n"}
