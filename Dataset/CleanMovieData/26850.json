The surviving astronaut, Dr. Beverly Owens ' is taken captive by the country\u2019s terrorist leader, Akmed Najah '. The U.S. Government fears the plutonium will be used to create a nuclear weapon and seeks help in the rescue and recovery efforts from ace stunt pilot, Zach Taylor '.Stockdale Flying Sequence ' Zach works with CIA operative, Bill Murphy ' who bares personal bitterness toward Akmed Najah. Najah had earlier destroyed Murphy\u2019s home, killing his wife and child. Zach learns that the downed spacecraft crashed into the jungles of Zamboa, an uncharted area that is difficult to travel. He and Murphy seek the aid of two young people who have lived their lives in the jungle. One is Desir\u00e9e Jones, daughter of a famous archeologist ' and a young boy whom she found in the jungle when he was a baby. The boy ' is now 8 years old but appears to be quite capable\u2026even demonstrating the capability of driving an old jeep.  Together, they set off to locate the terrorists and rescue Dr. Owens. After the spacecraft\u2019s crash landing, Owens detached the nuclear container from the onboard satellite before being taken captive. Akmed Najah systematically tortures the astronaut in order to force her to disclose the container\u2019s location. He discovers that a rescue search party is in process and sends out teams of trained assassins to stop them. Leading the killer Dacoits is a young man named Taj-a-tali ', son of Akmed Najah.  Zach, Murphy, Desir\u00e9e and Jason ' are attacked but manage to fend off the assault and capture Taj-a-tali. Later, Taj escapes with the help of other Dacoits and returns to his father\u2019s jungle lair. Akmed Najah is displeased with his son's performance and orders him killed together with Dr. Owens. Owens had succumbed to torture and revealed the plutonium location. No longer needing her, Najah orders that she and his son be dropped into a giant fire pit. Zach and Desir\u00e9e are separated from the others and after multiple misadventures discover the terrorists\u2019 hiding location in time to save Owens and Najah\u2019s son. Zach locates the space shuttle satellite and sets it to explode. In the meantime, Akmed Najah orders that the craft\u2019s payload container be flown out of the country to an unidentified eastern power. He later dies in a hand-to-hand battle with Zach. Desir\u00e9e escorts Owens and the boy to safety following a violent explosion decimates the terrorist lair. Learning that the plutonium is about to leave the jungle, Zach and Desir\u00e9e set out to stop the aerial pickup. Jason arrives in the jungle flying Zach\u2019s plane, which had been left back at their point of embarkation. The young boy flies the plane the same way he drives a vehicle\u2014with various difficulties and many \u201cups and downs.\u201d However, he manages to land the craft as Zach climbs aboard. A motorcade of Dacoits appear, firing weapons at the fleeing trio. Desir\u00e9e draws their fire while Zach and Jason turn the plane down a jungle runway. At the last minute, she leaps aboard the plane as it lifts from the ground. Zach skillfully pilots the aircraft and in several daring stunt maneuvers steals the aerial pickup from the Dacoits before it can be scooped into the air by others. Zach pulls the plane into an upward arch and then down toward the ground, suddenly flipping it over at the last minute so that it flies upside down. The rapid spinning causes Jason to become ill and as the plane approaches the Dacoits on the runway, Desir\u00e9e drops a hand grenade as the boy vomits. Both \u201cdroppings\u201d fall on the bad guys and the grenade explodes setting off surrounding explosives. High in the sky, Zach, Desir\u00e9e and Jason fly toward a setting sun. Zach asks Jason if he would like to fly. A very sick little boy replies, \u201cNo thank you!\u201d Zach, Desir\u00e9e and Jason are reunited with Bill Murphy who is taking care of Beverly Owens and a wounded Taj-a-tali. Murphy learns that his arch nemesis has been killed. In thought, Murphy opens a pocket watch given him by his dead wife and child. As the music plays, Taj-a-tali awakens and recognizes the music. In an emotional scene, the group comes to learn that the boy is not Najah\u2019s son but is instead, Murphy\u2019s son. The boy had been kidnapped the night that Akmed Najah killed Murphy\u2019s wife and destroyed their home. Jason who is feeling much better by now, smiles and say simply, \u201cThis has been a good day\u2026a very good day!\u201d\n"}
