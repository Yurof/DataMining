When not in class, Tom hangs out with his friend, Sly, who does not treat him like a blind person. In fact, he goes out of his way to challenge Tom. Tom likes to go jogging while Sly leads him on his bicycle. Sly leads him past obstacles such as park benches, shouting out \"Bench!\" at the last moment so Tom has to jump over it. On campus, Tom meets a black woman named Heather with whom he falls in love, but she breaks off the relationship because \"the black and white thing\" coupled with Tom's blindness is too complicated for her. Crushed by Heather's abandonment and experiencing loneliness, Tom continues to struggle with himself, still denying that his blindness affects his \"normalcy\". Then he meets his future wife, Patti, and his life changes forever.\n"}
