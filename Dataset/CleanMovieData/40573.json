Angie Woods, a stylist recognized for succeeding with difficult rejuvenation jobs, is found dead with a razor in her hand. Investigators suggest that Woods committed suicide because of the unattractive hairstyle she was wearing. Smithsonian , a fashion columnist and amateur private investigator, is an acquaintance of Woods and suspects something more sinister; she believes that a notable client of Woods, a congressional staffer with a salacious web site, is somehow implicated. Detective Vic Donovan  is assigned to the case. This causes complications due to his prior romantic affair with Smithsonian.\n"}
