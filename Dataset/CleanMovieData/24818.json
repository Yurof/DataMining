Bach's The Art of Fugue is to be recorded. Pierre-Laurent Aimard has decided in favor of concert grand piano Nr. 109 for the Bach recording. The film begins one year before the recording. Kn\u00fcpfer wants to study instruments from the time of Bach for Aimard. He experiments with sound absorbers made from felt and with glass sound mirrors. But as fate will have it, the number 109 grand piano is sold to Australia a few months later; and that is not the last obstacle that gets in their way. Kn\u00fcpfer and Aimard meet regularly, and when the tension is so thick it can be cut with a knife, Kn\u00fcpfer saves the day with his sense of humor. The road toward the pianist\u2019s longed for \u201cbravo\u201d is long. One afternoon, a rather sleepy artist in jeans and sneakers shows up. It is the Chinese star pianist Lang Lang, who will be giving a guest performance in the Viennese concert hall. Still suffering from jet lag, he has to choose an instrument to play. His overcrowded tour calendar leaves little time for individual settings. Instead, and almost shyly, he asks for a heavy bench that will hold up through his extroverted style of playing without sliding around. The piano superstar completes his performance in the large hall in a dark suit and wild hairstyle. The bench holds up, and he receives thunderous applause. The sketches of the comedy duo Igudesman & Joo always parody the elitist music world. Together with Kn\u00fcpfer they come up with some of the craziest scenarios for the next show. One of Alfred Brendel's last concerts takes place at the Grafenegg Music Festival. Kn\u00fcpfer prepares the piano for him while the star pianist gives his directions humorously.\n"}
