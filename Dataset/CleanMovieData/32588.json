His first entanglement is with babysitter Kocicka , a lean teenybopper who's more attached to her pet turtle than her older lover \u2013 at least until he accidentally smothers it in the dryer. Next in line is mature pop icon Nora , who's about to teach him a thing or two about freedom: the more people you let in, the more alone you end up feeling.\n"}
