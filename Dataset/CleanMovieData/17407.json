Unnikrishnan and Ulpalakshan feel that it\u2019s not easy trace Savithri and her daughter and so plan to bring in another girl as Ganapathy Iyer\u2019s daughter and to tell him that Savithri was no more, hoping that this would help Ganapathy recover from his illness. Then one day, Ulpalakshan brings in a girl and presents her before Iyer. Unnikrishnan is shocked to find that the girl, Shalu, is none other than the one he had seen earlier on the streets being chased by others. What happens from then forms the rest of the film.\n"}
