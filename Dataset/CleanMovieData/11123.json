Passengers: Jud Ellis  is escorting his fianc\u00e9 Louise Melhorn ; repentant political assassin Vasquel  is being transported back to the proper authorities by detective Crimp ; mobster Pete Bostwick (Jesse White  is accompanying a little boy named Tommy, whose father is Bostwick's boss; an elderly couple, Professor and Mrs. Spanger , are apparently on vacation; and jilted blonde bombshell Rena , on her way to a South American casino, is vying for Ellis's attention. After a temporary stop in Panama, Professor Spanger wishes to order \u201carroz con pollo\u201d at a local restaurant. His wife prevents him from ordering a dish not \u201cmeant for human consumption;\u201d the dish is merely Spanish for chicken and rice. During its flight, the aircraft enters a rough storm and is dangerously jostled about. A portable oxygen tank is loosened from its mooring, and crashes through one of the fuselage doors, killing the flight attendant, Maria Alvarez  who is thrown out of the aircraft. The crew is then forced to make an emergency landing in the jungle, aircraft intact. Crimp tries to take charge of the group, but the captain stops him. Momentarily, Ellis becomes psychologically unhinged, and tries to force himself upon Louise, but co-pilot Brooks steps in to dissuade him. Late at night, Crimp renders Bostwick temporarily unconscious, steals the gun he was guarding, then flees into the jungle. Later, the aircraft is repaired, but soon after searching and finding an errant Tommy, Bostwick and Rena discover Crimp\u2019s headless body. Soon, local head hunters shoot Bostwick dead by poison dart. The crew and passengers decide the best escape strategy; since there is only one good engine to help the aircraft fly over the mountains, the human cargo will have to be exceptionally light, so some will have to stay behind. With gun in hand, Vasquel forcibly takes charge of the matter, and chooses those that will be able to return to civilization; Ellis tries to stop him and is shot dead. The aircraft manages to take off, dropping off a cliff and then narrowly clearing the mountains. The elderly Spanger couple choose to stay behind, facing a horrible death from the head hunters. With only two bullets left in his gun, Vasquel shoots the Spanger couple and prays for forgiveness as he waits for his own death.\n"}
