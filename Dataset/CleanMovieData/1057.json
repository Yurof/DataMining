This angers his father, H\u00fcseyin, who wants him to study Agricultural Engineering so he can manage the family farm. During his years at university Sad\u0131k becomes a militant in left wing politics. Upon learning about Sad\u0131k's behavior, H\u00fcseyin disowns him. However worse days are ahead for Sad\u0131k. In the early hours of the morning on September 12, 1980 Sad\u0131k's pregnant wife starts having contractions. The couple runs outside, but they can't find anyone to take them to the hospital, due to a curfew. The country has been taken over in a military coup. Sad\u0131k's wife gives birth in a park and dies, but their son, Deniz, possibly named after leftist youth icon Deniz Gezmi\u015f, survives. Because of his political activities, Sad\u0131k is arrested, tortured, and imprisoned for three years during which time he loses his health. A few years after being released, he finds out that he will die. Having no other choice, he takes Deniz back to his family farm on the Aegean into the care of his mother and his father, who still does not speak to him. For Deniz, who is absorbed in the magical world of comic books, meeting his relatives on the farm is a new experience. There is his grandmother  who drives a tractor and speaks on a short wave radio, his aunt Hanife  who wears bracelets from her wrist all the way to her shoulder, and his uncle  who is a little naive. There is trouble in store, however, for Sad\u0131k and H\u00fcseyin who must come to terms with their past and each other. Sad\u0131k also needs to face his first love, now married with two children, and the question of old friends. However his sickness takes over and Sad\u0131k passes away. His parents take over the responsibility of Deniz who comes into term with his father's loss.\n"}
