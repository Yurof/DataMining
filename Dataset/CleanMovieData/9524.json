Two weeks after his birth, Aristides moves to Santos, a coastal city in S\u00e3o Paulo, with Dona Mocinha, a cousin of Dona Lindu. Lindu raises Lula's siblings alone until December 1952, when the family moves to Santos to meet the patriarch. Upon their arrival, Dona Lindu discovers that Aristides had formed a second family with Dona Mocinha. Aristides' two families lives in the same house and, as time goes on, they struggle to survive. Lula and his siblings attend elementary school and work as street vendors. Later, Lindu leaves the alcoholic and abusive Aristides and moves with her children to S\u00e3o Paulo. Lula receives a degree as lathe operator and gets a formal job in the car industry, where he loses a finger in a press. This and his brother Ziza's arrest leads him into trade union activism, which made him nationally known in a period when such activities were forbidden. Lula is incarcerated for his activities, just as his mother dies.\n"}
