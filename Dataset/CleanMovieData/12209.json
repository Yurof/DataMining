Shigeyuki is a junior high school student who will soon be taking a high school entrance examination. Unlike the high school student brother, Shinichi, who lives up to K\u014dsuke\u2019s expectations, Shigeyuki\u2019s grades are consistently poor. The white-collar workaholic father finds a private tutor, Yoshimoto , for Shigeyuki and imposes all responsibilities for his exam on the tutor. Even though Yoshimoto is a seventh year student of a third-rate university, Shigeyuki\u2019s marks become better and better.\n"}
