{"wikiId": "2730554", "titre": "Kopps", "dateSortie": "2003", "duree": "90.0", "genre": ["Comedy"], "resume": "The film concerns the police force of a small fictional Swedish village, H\u00f6gbotr\u00e4sk. The village is so peaceful that crime has become nonexistent. The police spend their shifts drinking coffee, eating hot dogs and chasing down runaway cows. This is all well and good for the village's own police, but the police management board wants to discontinue the local police force for lack of crime. This would mean the loss of income for the policemen, so they begin to stage crimes in order to preserve their jobs. This includes burning down the local hotdog stand, hiring a drunk to steal a packet of sausages, thrashing a local car, faking a shootout and staging a kidnapping using their friends as actors.\n"}
