It crashes and Dracula is impaled by one of the wheels. Van Helsing dies from his wounds. At that moment a follower of Dracula  arrives, collects Dracula's remains and, a few days later, buries them near Van Helsing's grave at St Bartolph's Church.  One hundred years later, a new generation of Britons appear who move the tale along: in this case, a group of young hippies that includes Jessica Van Helsing , granddaughter of Lorrimer Van Helsing , an occult expert and descendant of Dracula's old nemesis, and Johnny Alucard , who closely resembles the disciple of Dracula seen in 1872. Alucard persuades Jessica and the others to attend a black magic ceremony in the now abandoned, deconsecrated St Bartolph's, where he performs a bloody ritual involving one of their group, Laura Bellows . Jessica and the others flee in horror, after which Dracula is resurrected and kills Laura.  Laura\u2019s body is discovered, drained of blood, and a police investigation begins, headed by an Inspector Murray (Michael Coles . Murray suspects an occult element and interviews Lorrimer Van Helsing, who is shocked to learn the details of Laura\u2019s death. He realises that Johnny Alucard  is a disciple of Dracula, and that the Count must have returned. In the meantime, Alucard brings another of Jessica\u2019s friends, Gaynor Keating (Marsha Hunt , to St Bartolph\u2019s, where she is killed by Dracula and Alucard is himself turned into a vampire. The vampire Alucard kills a passer-by and lures Jessica\u2019s boyfriend, Bob , to a caf\u00e9 they frequent, where he turns him into a vampire as well. While Lorrimer is out, Bob goes to the Van Helsing house and persuades Jessica to come to the caf\u00e9, where he and Alucard capture her and take her to Dracula. Lorrimer tracks Alucard to his flat and kills him with the running water in the bathroom shower. He finds Bob's dead body and discovers Jessica in a trance at St Bartolph\u2019s, where Dracula plans to take his revenge on the Van Helsing family by turning her into a vampire. Van Helsing sets a trap for Dracula and waits for him to return at nightfall. After a struggle, Dracula is killed by a fall into a pit of stakes that Van Helsing had previously prepared, and his spell over Jessica is broken. She embraces her grandfather and the title \"Rest In Final Peace\" is shown.\n"}
