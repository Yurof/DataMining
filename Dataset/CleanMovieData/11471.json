{"wikiId": "8958592", "titre": "Hanna K.", "dateSortie": "1983-09-07", "duree": "111.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Political drama"], "resume": "Hanna K. is the story of Hanna Kaufman, a child of Holocaust survivors and an American-Jewish immigrant to Israel, who is a court-appointed lawyer assigned to defend a Palestinian, Salim Bakri, accused of terrorism and infiltration. Salim claims that he was trying to regain possession of his family house. Hanna saves him from a jail sentence, but he is deported to Jordan. Salim eventually returns, is jailed for illegal immigration, and he again asks for her services. Hanna investigates the story and discovered that Salim\u2019s family home is now a tourist attraction in Kafr Rimon, a settlement built and lived in by Russian Jews. Bakri\u2019s former village of Kufr Rumaneh has disappeared except for a few stones and trees. The state\u2019s attorneys offer Hanna a deal: if she drops the proceedings, they will arrange for Salim to become a South African citizen, and he can then return to Israel and try to get his property back. Hanna is confronted with the fact that one legacy of the Holocaust was the disposition of the Palestinians while her colleagues attempt to persuade her of the merits of the arrangement for Salim with the argument that Israel must be \u201cdefended\u201d even if Palestinians are denied their rights.Edward Said\u2019s review of Hanna K., The Village Voice, Oct. 11, 1983, p. 45 The film contained a number of aesthetic problems and Hanna\u2019s personal life at times overshadowed and muddled the political aspects of the story. Nevertheless, Edward Said, Parr Professor of English Literature at Columbia University, commented: \u201cAs a political as well as cinematic intervention, then Hanna K. is a statement of a great and I believe, lasting significance.\u201d\n"}
