Her income helps support her family, including an unemployed sister who is a single mother. Mar\u00eda becomes pregnant by a man she does not love. After unjust treatment from her boss she quits work despite her family's vehement disapproval. On her way to Bogot\u00e1 to find a new job, she is offered a position as a drug mule. Desperate, she accepts the risky offer, and swallows 62 wrapped pellets of Cocaine and flies to New York City with her immature friend Blanca. Mar\u00eda is almost caught by US customs who are suspicious of her movements. She avoids being X-rayed due to her pregnancy, and they ultimately believe her story that the father of her child paid for her air ticket. The traffickers collect Mar\u00eda and several other mules. The mules are held hostage in a motel room until they pass all the drug pellets. Fellow mule Lucy falls ill when a drug pellet apparently ruptures inside her. The traffickers cut her open to retrieve the drug pellets. Mar\u00eda convinces Blanca to escape with her when the traffickers leave to dump Lucy's body. They abscond with the drugs they have passed. Mar\u00eda has nowhere to sleep and goes to Lucy's sister's house but doesn't reveal to the sister that Lucy is dead. Blanca soon joins her there. Eventually the sister finds out and throws them out. Blanca and Mar\u00eda return the drugs to the traffickers and receive their money. Mar\u00eda uses some of her drug money to send Lucy's body home to Colombia. They are about to board the plane back to Colombia when Mar\u00eda decides to stay in the United States. Blanca returns home.\n"}
