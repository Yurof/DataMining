There are slight differences between Arany's work and the movie - for example, in the movie, Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia  and Fany\u0171v\u0151  are the same person. There are also references to ancient origin legends: \u0150sanya , \u0150sapa , and the Vil\u00e1gfa (World tree . The story's main character is Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia , who is a man with superhuman power. He is born as the third son of a horse, and he gains his power by suckling the horse's milk. He listens to old tales, mostly about the Forefather and the end of his reign, caused by evil dragons. After the horse's death, Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia decided to search and destroy the dragons, who seized power over the world. He met his two brothers, K\u0151morzsol\u00f3  and Vasgy\u00far\u00f3 , who also have superhuman abilities. In search of the Underworld's entrance , they accommodate themselves in a tree hollow. One of them stays there every day, in order to cook mush and make rope while the other two search for the entrance. An ancient and mischievous creature, H\u00e9tsz\u0171ny\u0171 Kapany\u00e1nyi Mony\u00f3k keeps asking them to give him some mush. K\u0151morzsol\u00f3 and Vasgy\u00far\u00f3 refuse to give him food, so H\u00e9tsz\u0171ny\u0171 attacks them and eats the mush from their belly. Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia, however, stops him by trapping his beard in the tree hollow. Trying to escape, H\u00e9tsz\u0171ny\u0171 fells the tree, and the heroes find the entrance of the Underworld under its roots. Only Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia dares to go down there, where he finds the three dragons and three princesses. After the victory, K\u0151morzsol\u00f3 and Vasgy\u00far\u00f3 rescue the princesses but leave Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia down in the Underworld. The desperate Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia finds a griffin's nest. A snake tries to eat the griffin chicks, but Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia stops it. To show his gratitude, the Griffin Father takes Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia to the upper world. The trip is very long so the griffin has to get some food in order to survive. Finally, Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia has to cut off his own legs to give something to the griffin to eat. After the arrival, the griffin chicks restore Feh\u00e9rl\u00f3fia's legs, which gives him more power. He is very angry at his brothers, but finally forgives them. All three marry with one of the princesses, and the Forefather restores the power which he lost by the dragon's arrival.\n"}
