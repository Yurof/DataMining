His roommate is the much more outgoing Rob, played by Patrick McColley. Their dorm room features walls covered with posters for horror and porn movies, as well as Christmas lights and cut out pictures of women\u2019s breasts, which is dubbed Rob\u2019s \u201cwall of tits.\u201d The room also features an unseen closet that is the home to all of Rob\u2019s drug paraphernalia. The film opens with a conversation about independent movies, which leads directly to the film\u2019s title. We then see Charlie and Rob in their film-201 classroom where Charlie fantasizes about Juliet, the girl who sits across from him. Juliet, played by Jocelyn DeBoer, seems to be a mixture of Charlie and Rob. She shares Charlie\u2019s main interests of horror movies and Kevin Smith, while being outgoing and a bit more vulgar like Rob. She also harbors feelings for Charlie, which is obvious the first time they interact on screen. Unfortunately, Charlie can\u2019t take a hint  and Rob develops a plan to get the two of them together. The next time Charlie helps Juliet in the editing bay, Rob convinces their bumbling Professor to end class early locking Charlie and Juliet in the classroom. Stuck spending the night together, Charlie and Juliet finally open up to each other. The film develops through a series of witty conversations and is filled with sharp dialogue, obscure movie references and indie film clich\u00e9s.Stuck Like Chuck on IMDB\n"}
