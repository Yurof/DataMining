Together with his equally down-on-their-luck co-workers Stan and Willie, Peter dreams of escaping the daily drudgery of \u201cdon\u2019t forget to sell the extended warranty\u201d, and \"if you have time to lean, you have time to clean\". Peter's existence in Big Box Retail Commission hell is further fueled by rival Salesman Rommel who steals Peter's customers and computer sales behind his back. Just when things seem to be at their worst, Peter\u2019s long lost high school buddy Frehley blows into town and turns Peter, Stan and Willie\u2019s humdrum lives into a non-stop beer-soaked party, full of loud music, strip clubs, and beautiful girls! And with Frehley yelling \u201cYou only live once!\u201d, Peter whips out the credit cards to buy his dream car, a classic Volkswagen Beetle. But when Frehley suddenly splits town, straight-laced Peter and his buddies are shocked to find themselves left with a massive hockey bag stuffed full of primo weed.\n"}
