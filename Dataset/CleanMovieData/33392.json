{"wikiId": "5703032", "titre": "The Haunted Castle", "dateSortie": "1921-04-27", "duree": "90.0", "genre": ["Mystery", "Silent film", "Indie", "Black-and-white"], "resume": "A company of men meets for a hunt lasting several days at Castle Vogel\u00f6d, hosted by Lord von Vogelschrey, but a sweeping rain brings the pleasure to nought and they spend their time in the inward parts of the castle. Even the non-invited Count Johann Oetsch appears. He gets eschewed by other partakers of the hunt since he is reputed to have shot his own brother, Peter, a few years ago. This rumour gets nourished by a retired Judge of the District Court. The widow of the brother, the remarried Baroness Safferst\u00e4tt, is also expected \u2013 which makes the situation unpleasant for the host. Count Oetsch neclects this matter and remains. The Baroness is affrighted by their coming and determined to depart again. The report of the coming of Father Faramund, allied with her former husband, is kept back by her; she will make confession unto him. In the following days, Oetsch and the Baroness \u2013 and the Baron \u2013 accuse one another of the murder of the brother of the Count. At the same time, in flashbacks, follows a confession in stages of the Baroness, that her marriage was anything but harmonious. Her husband became more and more interested in spiritual things than in her, so that she, in the presence of Baron Safferst\u00e4tt, a friend of her husband, had wished for something \"evil\" \u2013 which in turn had falsely interpreted it and thereafter shot her husband. This common trespass had finally let her and the Baron be married, without something else to feel for each other than emptiness. The Father takes his false beard and his wig off, revealing himself as Count Oetsch who now can justify his innocence. Baron Safferst\u00e4tt shoots himself. The true Father Faramund comes to the castle.\n"}
