Victims first experience a period of giddiness called \"Near Death Happiness\"  before expiring. Within minutes of death the victim rises again as a flesh-eating zombie\u2014a \"Stacy\". These Stacies run amok until they are cut into pieces in an act called a \"Repeat-Kill\" . The government has organized the poorly-trained \"Romero Repeat-Kill Troops,\" who ride around on garbage trucks, ordered to act out the disposal of the Stacies. By law, a Stacy may only be Repeat-Killed by her loved ones or the Romero Repeat Kill Troops. Through research, it is discovered that a key to the Stacy phenomenon is the \"Butterfly Twinkle Powder\"  that accumulates on the Stacies' skin.\n"}
