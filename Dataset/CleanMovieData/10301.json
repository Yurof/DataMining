{"wikiId": "3277789", "titre": "The Death of Mr. Lazarescu", "dateSortie": "2005-09-22", "duree": "148.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Medical fiction", "World cinema"], "resume": "Dante Remus L\u0103z\u0103rescu , a cranky retired engineer, lives alone with his three cats in a Bucharest apartment. In the grip of extreme pain, L\u0103z\u0103rescu calls for an ambulance, but once it becomes clear that no ambulance is coming, he asks for his neighbors' help. Not having the medicine L\u0103z\u0103rescu wants, and not wanting to worsen his condition by giving him the wrong medication, the neighbors give him some pills for his nausea. In the hallway, talking with his neighbor, we discover that L\u0103z\u0103rescu is a heavy drinker. His neighbor then helps L\u0103z\u0103rescu back to his apartment and lays him down on his bed. After L\u0103z\u0103rescu vomits blood strings, the neighbors decide to call an ambulance. When the ambulance finally arrives, the nurse, Mioara  dispels the idea that L\u0103z\u0103rescu's ulcer surgery over a decade before is the culprit for this pain. While performing a patient history, we learn that L\u0103z\u0103rescu's drink of choice is a strong, homemade liquor called Mastropol. The nurse suspects he has colon cancer, and, after informing his sister who lives in a different city that the condition could be serious and she should visit L\u0103z\u0103rescu in the hospital, the nurse decides to get him to a hospital. His sister makes arrangements to come the following day; his wife had died eight years earlier, and his only child, a daughter, lives in Toronto.  The film follows L\u0103z\u0103rescu's journey through the night, as he is carried from one hospital to the next. At the first three hospitals, the doctors, after much delay, reluctantly agree to examine L\u0103z\u0103rescu. Then, although finding that he is gravely ill and needs emergency surgery, keep refusing to hospitalize him and send him away. Meanwhile, his health deteriorates rapidly, his speech is reduced to babbling and he slowly loses consciousness. The reasons for neglecting him range from the fact that the hospitals are jammed with injured passengers from a bus accident to the doctors being only humans who are tired, bored, or simply do not feel like taking care of a smelly old drunkard. During the night, his only advocate is the paramedic, who stubbornly stays by him and tries to get him hospitalized and treated, while passively accepting verbal abuse from the doctors who look down on her. Finally, at the fourth hospital, the doctors accept L\u0103z\u0103rescu for an emergency operation to remove a blood clot in his brain, so that his incurable liver neoplasm can kill him, as one of the doctors in the film cynically comments.\n"}
