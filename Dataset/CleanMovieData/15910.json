{"wikiId": "35787800", "titre": "Bug Crawls", "dateSortie": "2004", "duree": "5.0", "genre": ["Short Film"], "resume": "Shot on digital video and set on a apocalyptic-industrial landscape reminiscent of works like Eraserhead or Industrial Soundscape, it features a bug crawling over a house and falling on his back. Accompanied by trademark dark ambient music, the short film ends with a close-up of the door opening, showing a lighted room with some kind of machinery on it, as the ambient sounds suggest a buzzing light and mechanical work.\n"}
