In Asia\u2019s safest city, the police have long been untouchable. Approaching midnight in Hong Kong, police headquarters receives an anonymous call: a fully loaded police van carrying the force\u2019s most advanced equipment and five highly trained officers has disappeared off the grid. The hijackers possess direct knowledge of police procedures and are already several steps ahead. The police must meet a list of demands to ensure the hostages\u2019 release, including the delivery of a large ransom. Any delay will cost lives. The clock has begun to tick. Rival Deputy Commissioners Sean Lau and Waise Lee fight to take charge of the rescue operation, code named COLD WAR. Lau wants to negotiate with the hijackers while covertly tracking them to their hideout. Lee is ready for an all-out aggressive attack, no matter the cost. For them, there\u2019s much more at stake than the safety of the hostages or the reputation of the police. With the Secretary for Security stepping down, the seat will soon be vacant. COLD WAR will decide who climbs to the top. Lau and Lee are aware that every decision is crucial, that each minute counts. But as they execute a carefully planned attack, they know they\u2019ve become unwitting pawns in a bigger, more dangerous game.\n"}
