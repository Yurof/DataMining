Nelson tries to escape to Mexico, but along the way he meets both the real killer  and the murder's investigator, Detective Arlen , who Nelson believes is trailing him. Chaotic events transpire and Nelson meets a narcoleptic farm girl, Lynn Holden . What follows is a bizarre series of misadventures marked with slapstick routines and constant one-liners.\n"}
