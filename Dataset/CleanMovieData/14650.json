He visits a brothel and claiming to have won the lottery and millions of euros, he propositions Daniela , one of the prostitutes to live with him for the sum of 100,000 euros a month until his money runs out. She accepts. Fran\u00e7ois' first doctor, Andr\u00e9, is worried that Daniela's volcanic sexuality will cause Fran\u00e7ois' heart to give out. The next day she takes Fran\u00e7ois to beach and he loves that fresh air. They both starts running with hands wide out and cheering in joy. Then they both involve in sex inside Fran\u00e7ois's car. That night Andr\u00e9 inquires them and finds their sexual activity that evening. Then Andr\u00e9 gives a moving speech about an idealistic and unrequited love he has for a nurse who later became his patient. Later, when Daniela suffers food poisoning and Andr\u00e9 is summoned to treat her, when she undresses he suffers a stroke and dies. At the funeral, Fran\u00e7ois learns that Andr\u00e9's nurse/patient/girlfriend had died some years before. The arrangement between Daniela and Fran\u00e7ois seems to work for a little while until Daniela's former lover, Charly  demands money to allow the relationship to continue. Fran\u00e7ois refuses and Daniela resumes being with Charly. While Daniela is having sex with Charly, she realizes she has really fallen in love with Fran\u00e7ois who has meanwhile, started an affair with his next-door neighbor. The film concludes with a surreal pastiche of fantasy and conjecture which begins with Fran\u00e7ois admitting that he never won the lottery. As the film has started somewhat as a complex story, it continues in the same way; till the last ten minutes wherein a comedic party starts. Daniela entices a friend of Fran\u00e7ois and moves him away to sex. Seeing that, everyone comments her; but Fran\u00e7ois is unmoved. Then the film ends, with the final shot picturing Daniela and Fran\u00e7ois dining together. A new life starts for them.\n"}
