The expedition met disastrous results when its ship became trapped and ultimately crushed in the ice pack. Shackleton and his 26-man crew endured the long polar winter before ultimately finding rescue following an 800-mile open boat voyage on the Weddell sea. Against all odds, the entire crew of The Endurance survived. Frank Hurley's original film footage was used by Butler along with interviews of surviving relatives to present the story of Shackleton's expedition.\n"}
