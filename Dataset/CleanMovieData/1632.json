Michael , a Roman Catholic and recovering alcoholic, is preparing to host a birthday party for his friend Harold. Another of his friends, Donald , a self-described underachiever who has moved from the city, arrives and helps Michael prepare. Alan (Peter White , Michael's  old college roommate from Georgetown, calls with an urgent need to see Michael. Michael reluctantly agrees and invites him to his home. One by one, the guests arrive. Emory  is a stereotypical flamboyant interior decorator; Hank , a soon-to-be-divorced schoolteacher, and Larry , a fashion photographer, are a couple, albeit one with monogamy issues; and Bernard  is an amiable black bookstore clerk. Alan calls again to inform Michael he isn't coming after all, and the party continues in a festive manner. However, Alan does appear unexpectedly and throws the gathering into turmoil. \"Cowboy\"  \u2013 a male hustler and Emory's \"gift\" to Harold \u2013 arrives. As tensions mount, Alan assaults Emory and in the ensuing chaos Harold finally makes his grand appearance. Michael begins drinking again. As the guests become more and more intoxicated, the party moves indoors from the patio due to a sudden downpour. Michael, who believes Alan is a closeted homosexual, begins a game in which the objective is for each guest to call the one person whom he truly believes he has loved. With each call, past scars and present anxieties are revealed. Michael's plan to \"out\" Alan with the game appears to backfire when Alan calls his wife, not the male college friend Justin Stewart whom Michael had presumed to be Alan's lover. As the party ends and the guests depart, Michael collapses into Donald's arms, sobbing. When he pulls himself together, it appears his life will remain very much the same.\n"}
