Instigated by Fest\u2019Africa, a dozen African authors met four years after the events as writers in residence at Kigali, to try to break the silence of African intellectuals on this genocide. In May 2000, on the occasion of the publication of series of works based on this experience, writers and artists from Africa and elsewhere gathered in Rwanda. Facing up to the scars left by the genocide, Samba Felix N\u2019Diaye manages to find just the right sense of distance to film the inexpressible while nevertheless communicating a message of hope. Writers in the film include Boubacar Boris Diop, V\u00e9ronique Tadjo, Benjamin Sehene, Nocky Djedanoum, Koulsy Lamko and Yves Simon, who all participated in a writer in residence program organized in Rwanda in May 2000 by the Fest'Africa literature festival based in Lille, France.<ref nameBartlet|firstRwanda pour m\u00e9moire|accessdateAfricultures|url2824}}\n"}
