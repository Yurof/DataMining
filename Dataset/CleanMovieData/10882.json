{"wikiId": "2210733", "titre": "Bhumika: The Role", "dateSortie": "1977", "duree": "139.0", "genre": ["World cinema", "Musical", "Drama", "Art film", "Bollywood"], "resume": "Bhumika tells the life story of a Bollywood actress, Usha ,who is the granddaughter of a famous female singer of the old tradition from Devadasi community of Goa. Usha's mother married to an abusive and alcoholic Brahmin. Following his early death, and over her mother\u2019s objections, Usha is taken to Bombay by family hanger-on Keshav Dalvi  to successfully audition as a singer in a Bombay studio: the first step in a process, watched approvingly by her doting grandmother and with horror by her mother, that will eventually carry her to on-camera adolescent stardom, and to an ill-starred love marriage with Keshav. Usha\u2019s motives for stubbornly pursuing this relationship  with the unattractive and much older Keshav\u2014who appears to have lusted after her since childhood\u2014are not spelled out. Presumably she feels indebted to him for his loyalty to her family  and for her own worldly success; she is also a headstrong girl who clearly enjoys her acting career and is bent on challenging her uptight mother . Once the two are wed, Usha is shocked to find Keshav continuing to act as her \u201cbusiness manager,\u201d arranging starring roles for her opposite hunky heartthrob Rajan , who is himself in  love with her. Since Keshav\u2019s other business ventures are unsuccessful, the family remains entirely dependent on Usha\u2019s earnings \u2014 a fact that Keshav clearly resents. He thus becomes both a jealous husband with a fragile ego and nasty temper, as well as  a greedy pimp who compels his wife to take risqu\u00e9 work despite her dislike of her costar and her protests that she \u201conly wants to be a housewife\u201d now that their daughter has been born. Not surprisingly, the relationship becomes increasingly poisoned, particularly by Keshav\u2019s assumption  that she is in fact having an affair with Rajan. Verbally and physically abused by her husband and periodically obliged to live in a hotel, separated from her daughter and mother, the desperately unhappy actress eventually does instigate two unsatisfying liaisons\u2014with the nihilistic and self-centered director Sunil Verma , with whom she plots a double-suicide , and then with the wealthy businessman Vinayak Kale , who keeps her as a pampered mistress on his palatial estate. Here Usha briefly finds a kind of \u201crespectability\u201d as a de facto second wife, earning a measure of love and admiration from Kale\u2019s mother, son, and bedridden first wife\u2014but  at the cost of even the most rudimentary freedom. Unable to abide by Kale\u2019s hypocritical domestic rules, she finds her only hope of escape to lie in the intervention of the hated Keshav, who promptly brings her back to a Bombay festooned with billboards of her own face, and to the same drab hotel and lonely prospects. As Kale\u2019s bitter wife remarks to Usha as the latter prepares to leave, \u201cThe beds change, the kitchens change. Men\u2019s masks change, but men don\u2019t change.\u201d One thing the movie could not clarify was the reason why Usha liked and then disliked Rajan. The climax of the movie is gloomy and the viewer is left out to seek the message of the movie on their own. http://www.uiowa.edu/~incinema/Bhumika.html\n"}
