Henry opens the world of literature to Simon, and is inspired to write \"the great American poem\". Simon struggles to get his work recognized, and it is often dismissed as pornographic tat, but Henry continues to push and inspire Simon into getting the poem published. Henry carries around a bundle of notebooks he refers to as \"His Confession\", a work that details aspects of his mysterious past that he one day hopes to publish, when he and the world is ready for them. Henry's hedonistic antics cause all manner of turns in the lives of Simon's family, not least of which is impregnating Fay Grim . As Simon begins an ascent to the dizzying heights of Nobel Prize-winning poet, Henry sinks to a life of drinking in low-life bars as his own attempts at fame result in rejection, even by Simon's publisher who once employed Henry. The friends part ways and lose touch until Henry\u2019s criminal past catches up with him as he needs Simon\u2019s help in fleeing the country.\n"}
