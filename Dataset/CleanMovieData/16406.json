There he meets the American Caroline Hartley  and her 18-year old ward Elinor . Ashby is drawn to them both, particularly Elinor, but is rather surprised when they arrive in Oxford and rent a house. Women are not allowed in the College, nor are Fellows allowed to marry, which puts him in an embarrassing situation. Ashby's rival for the post of College President, Oliver Syme , takes full advantage of this to try to discredit Ashby.\n"}
