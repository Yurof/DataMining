The film begins with Julie Pommeraye walking the streets of Paris; she goes to a cinema and from the tickets queue calls her boyfriend Isma\u00ebl B\u00e9noliel on her cell phone. He is at work with Alice, but when Julie asks him he lies and says he is alone. Julie responds that he pisses her off. Later that night, Isma\u00ebl runs into Julie on his way home. They discuss Julie\u2019s frustrations about their relationship and eventually, already in their apartment, become reconciled. Shortly afterwards Alice arrives; they all get into bed together, read a different book each and fight about each one's place in bed. The next day Julie and Isma\u00ebl have breakfast with Julie\u2019s family; Julie gets frustrated and leaves for the kitchen, followed by her older sister, Jeanne. Julie tells Jeanne and later her mother about Alice and the threesome. In the night, after Isma\u00ebl, Julie and Alice leave a bar where they were eating, Julie starts complaining about Isma\u00ebl's relationship with Alice; Isma\u00ebl responds that so is she and that she is the only one he loves, Alice tells them that she is only there to bring them together. They go to a concert where Alice befriends a guy named Gwendal. Julie starts feeling bad, so she and Isma\u00ebl decide to leave. Julie goes out of the building while Isma\u00ebl gets their stuff; when he comes outside he finds Julie unconscious on the floor while a woman performs CPR on her. The police arrive and question Isma\u00ebl while paramedics attend to Julie. One of the paramedics talks to a police officer who then goes back to the car in which Isma\u00ebl is sitting and over the radio reports Julie\u2019s death. Going to work, Isma\u00ebl runs into Jeanne on her way to the apartment to pick some of Julie\u2019s clothes up, after an argument about why she didn\u2019t tell him first, Isma\u00ebl gives her his keys. At work he tells about this Alice who doesn't like it; they argue then comfort each other. Since Jeanne is staying in Isma\u00ebl\u2019s apartment he doesn't want to spend the night there and Alice takes him to Gwendal\u2019s apartment. Isma\u00ebl spends the entire night awake; in the morning he meets Erwann, Gwendal\u2019s younger brother, who before leaving for school offers him his room so he can sleep in his bed. When Erwann returns and wakes Isma\u00ebl up he borrows some clean clothes from Erwann and leaves for work. When he returns from it he is secretly followed then met by Erwann who asks him if he can go home with him; Isma\u00ebl rejects this. He gets to his apartment to find Jeanne still there, which annoys him and he goes to Erwann\u2019s apartment to spend the night there again. At a lunch with Julie\u2019s family next day Isma\u00ebl rejects an offer to her life insurance money from her father. At night he takes Maude, a waitress from the bar he used to go to with Julie and Alice, for a one-night stand to his apartment. They wake up at noon to realize that Jeanne is present: Isma\u00ebl leaves and Jeanne is disappointed when she finds out the girl is not Alice. Isma\u00ebl goes to work to find Erwann waiting for him; he tells Erwann that he is flattered by his attention but neither interested nor in need of him. Alice, having broken up with Gwendal, thinks Erwan had been sent there to pick up their apartment keys; she gives them to Isma\u00ebl to pass them on to Erwann. Leaving work Isma\u00ebl finds Erwann waiting for him again; he gives him the keys then takes them back and they both go to Isma\u00ebl\u2019s apartment. Meanwhile Alice receives a phone call from Julie\u2019s mother; the two of them meet at a restaurant, where Julie\u2019s mother asks her to take care of Isma\u00ebl. Jasmine, Julie\u2019s other sister, comes to tell her mother that her father is upset that she isn\u2019t at home so late at night, so she leaves, leaving Alice and Jasmine talking alone for a while. In Isma\u00ebl\u2019s apartment he and Erwann make love; in the morning Jeanne finds them in bed together and leaves again. Isma\u00ebl follows her; Jeanne says that now she understands why he and Julie were in a threesome with Alice and why he didn\u2019t want to have kids; they argue until Isma\u00ebl leaves. Erwann goes to look for Isma\u00ebl in his office, but not finding him talks to Alice, who asks him when he is leaving whether he and Isma\u00ebl are together, to which he replies that he hopes so. Isma\u00ebl is in the meantime in the cemetery visiting Julie's grave; the following song is sung as if by Julie\u2019s ghost, asking Isma\u00ebl why it had taken him so long to visit her. After leaving the cemetery Isma\u00ebl walks despondently through the city and gets drunk; Alice comes across him and takes him to Erwann\u2019s apartment. Isma\u00ebl and Erwann argue about whether their relationship should continue and the movie ends with Isma\u00ebl kissing Erwann and asking him to love him less but for a long time.\n"}
