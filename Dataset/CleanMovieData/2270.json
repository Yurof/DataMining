The weapon causes an enemy\u2019s troops to lose the will to fight, thereby making conquest in battle far easier. This is part of Alexander\u2019s dual goal: to conquer the world in the manner of Alexander the Great and to break each of the major moral codes in so doing . U.N.C.L.E. becomes involved after the theft of the weapon and agents Napoleon Solo  and Illya Kuryakin  are assigned. Also searching for Alexander is his estranged wife Tracey , although her motive is to serve him with divorce papers that will allow her to get $1,000,000 she put into the marriage. Through a series of coincidences , Solo, Kuryakin, and Tracey end up joining forces. As a result they are at various times captured, tortured, left to die in an elaborate way in an Egyptian tomb, and otherwise thwarted by Alexander throughout the film. Alexander believes that if he is able to assist a military junta in the takeover of a small country that he can use that country as a base for world conquest. By careful planning, he combines his final violation of a commandment - killing the country\u2019s leader - with the takeover of the country and the start of his march toward global domination. Intervention by U.N.C.L.E. prevents the assassination, and during his escape Alexander is killed by his own accomplice Kavon .\n"}
