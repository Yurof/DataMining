British Army Captain Jack Connor arrives to investigate what's happening at the McKenzie POW Camp. Connor believes the camp disturbances are a cover for an escape attempt. During a mass brawl two POWs escape dressed as British soldiers and Connor notices an outcast German POW named Neuchl (Horst Janson , being dragged from the barracks and fleeing from the Germans. He is badly beaten and later that night in the hospital is strangled before Connor gets the chance to learn about Schl\u00fcter's plans. With Connor investigating the camp, Schl\u00fcter leads his 28-man escape party out of a tunnel the next day. Meeting the two escapees who have arranged a U-boat to pick them up, they all head for the coast. Unknown to Schl\u00fcter, Connor has broken the code used in letters sent by POWs to Germany and knows the plan. Connor, along with, General Kerr (Jack Watson , starts searching for the prisoners. The Germans head for the coast and burn their escape lorry, which is seen by a reconnaissance plane. Drawn by the burning lorry, Connor  locates the Germans attempting to paddle towards a surfaced U-boat at dusk. Connor calls in a Royal Navy motor torpedo boat  with depth charges to engage the U-boat. With only 50 yards to go, Connor orders the pilot to 'buzz' the inflatable dinghies, delaying Schl\u00fcter's craft, and with the MTB arriving, the U-boat dives, leaving Schl\u00fcter and three comrades stranded.\n"}
