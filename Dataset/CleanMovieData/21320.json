{"wikiId": "365212", "titre": "The Belly of an Architect", "dateSortie": "1987", "duree": "119.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Comedy-drama", "Experimental film", "Indie", "Avant-garde"], "resume": "The American architect Stourley Kracklite has been commissioned to construct an exhibition in Rome dedicated to the architecture of Etienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e. Doubts arise among his Italian colleagues to the legitimacy of Boull\u00e9e among the pantheon of famed architects, perhaps because Boull\u00e9e was an inspiration for Adolf Hitler's architect Albert Speer. Tirelessly dedicated to the project, Kracklite's marriage quickly dissolves along with his health. His physical and social ruin in some way corresponds to the decline of his idol Boull\u00e9e, who remained relatively forgotten until the twentieth century. Kracklite becomes obsessed with the historical Caesar Augustus after hearing that Livia, the wife of Augustus, supposedly poisoned him. Kracklite assumes that his own wife Louisa has tried to do the same due to his increasing stomach pains.\n"}
