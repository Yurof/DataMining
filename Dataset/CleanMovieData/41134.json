The mayor recruits a crazy electrician called Emin  and some of his office staff to help him to set up the signal receiver on the highest position of the mountain. While Latif seeks to undermine his efforts by decrying television as the work of the Devil and a slap in the face of Islamic tradition. The story is based on the childhood memories of the writer-director Y\u0131lmaz Erdo\u011fan of the arrival of the first television to Hakk\u00e2ri, Turkey in the 70's.\n"}
