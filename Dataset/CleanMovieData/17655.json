The show contained multiple references and gags that take jabs at the original show, musical numbers by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Matthew Sweet, and concluded with a nonsensical ending, with Coleman pointing out all of the plot holes in the story. Scooby interrupts him by licking his face until the episode ends.\n"}
