From there, mayhem ensues, knocking things over; chased by the police, smugglers, counterfeiters, and murderers; and harangued by his Mother-in-law. It\u2019s a question of who will survive to recover the goods, or live to spend it. It's a star-studded romp, with many familiar faces and character actors in this screwball comedy caper. Still, ask your Vet before giving your dogs bones, or chocolate, or loot!\n"}
