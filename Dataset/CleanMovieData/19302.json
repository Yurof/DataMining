He is accidentally killed while trying to escape after murdering his cheating wife and her lover, but he is later revived by a female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ehrmann, who uses him in her mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovers her underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor's failed experiments. The crazed scientist revives Waldemar's murdered ex-wife, who also becomes a werewolf from being fatally bitten by Daninsky, and forces the two werewolves to fight. Waldemar kills his wife again, and is in turn shot to death by a woman who loves him enough to end his torment.\n"}
