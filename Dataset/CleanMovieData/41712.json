The assailant kills Dion\u00eds, leads the blindfolded horse to a cliff's edge then pushes the wagon with Dion\u00eds and his son, Culet, off the cliff. Andreu, an 11-year-old boy, discovers the wreckage of the fallen cart. Culet is still alive but manages to say a single word before dying: Pitorliua, the name that villagers have given to a ghost believed to haunt a cave. The falangist mayor of the town suspects that Farriol, Andreu\u2019s father, is involved in the deaths of Dionis and his son. Farriol, who was Dion\u00eds\u2019s business partner dealing with birds, is an easy target for incrimination due to his suspicious background as a supporter of the Second Spanish Republic, which was repressed by the Francoist Spain. Years before, the mayor and Farriol were rivals vying for the love of Flor\u00e8ncia, Andreu\u2019s mother, who ultimately chose Farriol as her husband, cementing the major resentment against both of them. Fearing for his life, Farriol decides to flee and cross the border into France. Flor\u00e8ncia has to work in a factory in Vic so Andreu is sent to live with his paternal relatives in a house full of women and children. \u00c0via, Andreu\u2019s old grandmother and Ci\u00f3, a widower aunt who has a son a few years older than Andreu, work looking after the country home of the richest family of the region, the Manuben. There is also a younger aunt, Enriqueta, who is being pressured into marrying an older neighbour she does not love. The grim household is completed by Andreu\u2019s orphan cousin N\u00faria, a maimed but beautiful girl around his age, who lost a hand while playing with a grenade. Soon Andreu begins to unearth his family\u2019s dark secrets. His aunt, Enriqueta, is the talk of the village because she is carrying on a secret affair with a civil guard. The precocious and lively N\u00faria is engaging in sexual games with her alcoholic school teacher. Andreu befriends an older boy who he first spots bathing naked in a river in the forest. The boy is a tuberculosis patient in a nearby monastery, who imagines he has angels' wings. Andreu helps him by setting aside some food for him. Farriol, as Andreu accidentally discovers, has not really left for France but is hiding in the farmhouse attic. N\u00faria and Andreu become frequent companions roaming the mysterious forest together. She has a crush on him and tries a sex game, but he rejects her sexual advances. When the mayor orders a search of the farmhouse, Farriol is found and sent to prison. Farriol furtively tells Andreu to convince Flor\u00e8ncia to ask for help from the influential Mrs. Manubens. Flor\u00e8ncia pays her a visit. Because the rich lady is childless and has a weakness for children Flor\u00e8ncia takes Andreu with her. Mrs. Manubens reluctantly writes a letter to the mayor interceding on behalf of Farriol. However, the mayor tries to take sexual advantage of Flor\u00e8ncia instead. Andreu slowly discovers that his mother has a secret of her own. In her youth she was a close friend of Pitorliua, the ghost of the legend, who was actually a delicate young man. Visiting his burial place, Andreu and N\u00faria encounter Pauletta, Dion\u00eds\u2019s half-demented widow. Pauletta tells them that Pitorliua was the homosexual lover of the only brother of Mrs. Manubens and because of this he was castrated. She implies that Farriol had something to do with it. Exploring the cave where Pitorliua was castrated Andreu and N\u00faria discover the names of the culprits on the wall: Dion\u00eds and Farriol. Andreu confronts his mother and Flor\u00e8ncia confesses that Dion\u00eds and Farriol were paid by Mrs. Manubens to scare Pitorliua off, but things went too far. Farriol is condemned to death. Before he is executed Flor\u00e8ncia and Andreu visit him in jail to say goodbye. He tells his son not to forget his ideals. After Farriol\u2019s funeral Pauletta spitefully reveals to Flor\u00e8ncia and Andreu that Farriol was the killer of her husband and son following orders from Mrs. Manubens. Dion\u00eds tried to blackmail her and Mrs. Manubens first got rid of Dion\u00eds and then of Farriol. The rich lady bought Farriol\u2019s silence in exchange for providing an excellent education for Andreu. Andreu begins to reject his family full of lies and deceptions. Instead of running away with N\u00faria as they originally planned, he ultimately accepts to be educated at the expense of Mrs. Manubens. Flor\u00e8ncia comes to see him at the boarding school, but Andreu has not forgiven his parents. When a classmate asks him who was the woman who came to see him he just answers that it was a woman from his village.\n"}
