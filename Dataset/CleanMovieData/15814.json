{"wikiId": "9598712", "titre": "Fuerza A\u00e9rea Sociedad An\u00f3nima", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "85.0", "genre": ["Indie", "Documentary"], "resume": "The documentary portrays a behind-the-scenes look at the poor state of Argentina's civil aviation, and puts the blame on the Argentine Air Force. The Air Force has been in control of air traffic operations since the military takeover of General Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda in 1966. The producer/director, Enrique Pi\u00f1eyro, claims Argentina and Nigeria are the only countries whose air force controls and regulates the airline industry. Pi\u00f1eyro, a former Argentine airline pilot, makes his case in the documentary using diagrams, 3D animations, interviews, hidden cameras in the control tower, and a few props. For example, at one point he spills out a bag of plastic airplanes and equates it to the number of planes the air force has lost due to negligence. The film is heavily based on the Austral L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Flight 2553 plane crash. Enrique Pi\u00f1eyro takes his camera, secretly, into the control tower of the Ministro Pistarini International Airport also-known-as Ezeiza, the international airport at Buenos Aires.\n"}
