{"wikiId": "11585359", "titre": "Pi\u00f1ata", "dateSortie": "2005", "duree": "4.0", "genre": ["Computer Animation", "Short Film", "Comedy"], "resume": "A pi\u00f1ata (voiced by Mark Mitchell  suspended from a rope on a tree, awakens as if coming to life for the first time. It hears the noise of children and wants to join them, but can't . Soon though, a girl , with only her sombrero showing, wielding a large  stick approaches and begins swinging unsuccessfully at the pi\u00f1ata. Shortly, another child shows up with a stick that can reach it and the pi\u00f1ata, to its surprise, gets hit across the face. To its horror, more children  show up and attack it. This happens a few more times, until the pi\u00f1ata climbs up its rope out of their reach using its teeth. The children are dismayed, until an adult, represented by a larger sombrero, comes in with a stick large enough to reach the pi\u00f1ata. The adult winds up for the hit and begins shaking. The pi\u00f1ata also begins shaking. Just before the adult strikes, the pi\u00f1ata, in a great state of fear and panic, is struck by a vicious bout of diarrhea, which, for a pi\u00f1ata, is in the form of its contents, that is, candy. The children rejoice and the pi\u00f1ata is relieved, since it is now left alone. But to its surprise, as the film finishes, it is attacked once more by the original little girl, who has acquired the large stick used by the adult.\n"}
