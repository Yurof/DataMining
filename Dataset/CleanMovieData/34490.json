Jos\u00e9 is a man romantically possessed and obsessed by his childhood in Granada during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in the spring of 1936. Now in his fifties, Jos\u00e9 returns to Granada and relives his childhood there. A time when he fell in love with Garcia Lorca and had a youthful affair with one of Lorca's own lovers. Memories come flooding back to the mature Jos\u00e9, of youthful sexual conquest, of Lorca's murder at the hands of Franco's agents, and his own early homosexual affairs. Jos\u00e9's entire life is colored by his obsessions with Garcia Lorca, his unknown God, to whom the film is dedicated. Jos\u00e9 travels twice to Granada. First, he revisits a woman who is also obsessed with Garcia Lorca's memory, and steals a photograph of the boy with whom he had his first sexual encounter; later, Jos\u00e9 returns to Madrid, to a party in search of his youth, and meets a pianist with whom he had sexual relations many years before but now does not remember. When Jos\u00e9 returns to Madrid, he is a man tormented by his past, and in search of peace. Listening to a taped recording of Garcia Lorca's famous \"Ode to Walt Whitman\", he desires nothing more than to face the rest of his life in loneliness, although his recent lover, Miguel has returned to his bed and wants to continue their affair. Jos\u00e9 realizes that he is really all alone in their world, alone with his God.\n"}
