{"wikiId": "7680299", "titre": "Drowned Out", "dateSortie": "2002", "duree": "87.0", "genre": ["Documentary"], "resume": "The documentary follows the villagers of Jalsindhi \u2013 a village in Madhya Pradesh on the banks of the Narmada River about 10 miles upstream from the Sardar Sarovar project - through their battle against the dam. The lead character is Luharia Sonkaria, who is the village\u2019s medicine man, a role that was his father\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s before him. The government provides them no viable alternatives - they offer unusable land a hundred miles away or a small sum of money in compensation for their river-side land. The film documents hunger strikes, rallies, and a six year Supreme Court case, and finally follows the villagers as the dam fills and the river starts to rise. The documentary features Arundhati Roy, who has been an outspoken activist bringing international attention to the controversy.\n"}
