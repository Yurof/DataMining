Young Milo\u0161 Hrma is engaged as an unpaid employee in a small railway station. The stationmaster, an enthusiastic pigeon-breeder, has a kind wife, but is envious of the train dispatcher Hubi\u010dka's success with women. Milo\u0161 holds a platonic love for young conductor M\u00e1\u0161a. The experienced Hubi\u010dka tries to explain to him the \"matters of love\" and discovers that Milo\u0161 is a virgin. The idyll of the railway station is disturbed by the arrival of the councillor, Zednicek, a Nazi supporter. M\u00e1\u0161a spends the night with Milo\u0161, but he finds no success and, the next day, he attempts suicide. He is saved, and the doctor explains to him that ejaculatio praecox is normal at Milo\u0161's age. The doctor recommends that Milo\u0161 seek the assistance of an experienced woman. During the nightshift, Hubi\u010dka flirts with the telegraphist, Zdeni\u010dka, and imprints her buttocks with the office's rubber stamps. Her mother complains to Hubi\u010dka's superiors. The scandal prevents the stationmaster from becoming inspector. The Germans are nervous, since their trains are attacked and blown up by the partisans. An attack is also planned for this station. Young artiste Viktoria Freie delivers a bomb to the station. At Hubi\u010dka's request, Viktoria also helps Milo\u0161 to \"resolve\" his problem with virginity. The encouraged Milo\u0161 sets up the booby-trap himself. The endeavor is successful, but the young man also dies during the course of events.\n"}
