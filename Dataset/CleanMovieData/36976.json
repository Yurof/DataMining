Marnelle doesn\u2019t want to use his invention for evil but he\u2019s threatened by his Nazi masters, including Von Schweig with a concentration camp. Marnelle destroys his lab and manages to escape with his daughter Elsa \u2013 but is then recaptured. We then meet two members of the British secret service who are in a caf\u00e9 \u2013 when another man is arrested the two of them flee. They trick a passing German car into stopping and knock them out \u2013 to discover Marnelle and his daughter are in the back seat, prisoners. They take the Germans uniforms, drive the prisoners to the airport and manage to escape in a plane. The Marnelles go to Australia but the Nazis find out about it and decide to track him there. Marnelle starts working for the Australian air force and meets pilot Frank Miller. Nazi officer Von Schweig arrives in Australia and meets up with local fifth columnists who are planning sabotage on Australian planes \u2013 Miller's ends up crashing and he winds up in hospital. By this stage the war has started and there is a scene where Von Schweig and a fifth columnist, Dr Vass, looks at some Aussie soldiers marching past. Von Schweig says \u201cwe did not expect the enthusiasm of the dominions\u201d for the war. Dr Vass says he\u2019s been to Australia for a number of years and still doesn\u2019t understand them, adding that \u201cyou expect from their interest in sport that nothing else matters but in war the greater the danger the harder they fought\u201d. Miller and his friend Ted Jackson visit the Marnelles in their rural hideaway, where they are looked after by a comic Chinaman; Ted has fallen for Elsa. The fifth columnists and Von Schweig meet up with a spy who is revealed to be Frank Miller. Miller tells them where to find the scientist; they capture and start torturing him to find the formula. The Germans are about to take the Marnelles back but to Europe but Mack manages to sneak off and inform the authorities. Ted Jackson rescues Marnelle but Miller's treachery enables the Germans to take off with the formula.
