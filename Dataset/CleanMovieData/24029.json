{"wikiId": "21743943", "titre": "The Ape Woman", "dateSortie": "1964", "duree": "100.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Black-and-white"], "resume": "The \"Ape Woman\" is Annie Girardot, completely covered with hair; the entrepreneur Tognazzi discovers her in a convent in Naples; he marries her  and begins exhibiting her to the public. He tries to sell her to a funny guy who insists on her virginity, but she is a little reluctant. After tasting success in Paris, she dies during childbirth. Tognazzi recovers her mummy from the museum of natural history and exhibits it in Naples. The subject looks a little camp, but the film is considered one of the most touching of Ferreri's.\n"}
