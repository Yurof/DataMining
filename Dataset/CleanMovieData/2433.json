{"wikiId": "26241300", "titre": "The Adventuress", "dateSortie": "1950", "duree": "101.0", "genre": ["Drama", "World cinema"], "resume": "The story of Aventurera, with its twists and turns, is typical of the 1950s films from Mexico. The story of a young, and naive young woman who learns about her mother's disloyalty to a father she adores, sends this film spinning into a real adventure. Along the way, we are taken to watch Elena Tejero deal with the evils around her. She will remain a good woman no matter what. As in all the Mexican telenovelas that are a staple of that country's TV, Aventurera keeps building up on unsavory situations where our heroine will have to fight against until everything turns well at the end. Elena Tejera is different in many ways; she never stoops low to the sleazy life where everyone wants to get her into. Nin\u00f3n Sevilla, the Cuban born star of Aventurera, makes a charismatic appearance in the film. Tito Junco as Lucio Saenz has some good moments. Andrea Palma is excellent as the villainous Rosaura and Ruben Rojo is the kind Mario. The film inspired the 1990s and 2000s stage success produced by Carmen Salinas. The stage production was starred by notable Mexican stars like Edith Gonz\u00e1lez, Itat\u00ed Cantoral, Maribel Guardia and many others.\n"}
