Engstr\u00f6m is a police inspector formerly with the Swedish Police Service who moved to Norway after being caught having sex with the main witness in one of his cases. Vik is nearing retirement age, and his memory is ailing. Engstr\u00f6m devises a plan to lure the murderer back to the scene of the crime, but the stakeout is blown and the murder suspect flees into the fog. Events take a turn for the worse when the fugitive shoots one of the pursuing unarmed Norwegian police officers. Without telling his colleagues, however, Engstr\u00f6m carries a gun from his days in the Swedish police, who routinely carry firearms. While shooting at what he believes to be the suspect, Engstrom accidentally kills Vik, who had mistakenly run right instead of left as ordered. Engstr\u00f6m initially tells the truth about the shooting, but realizes that everyone assumes that the fugitive shot Vik. He decides to conceal his culpability. When one of Engstr\u00f6m's colleagues, Hilde Hagen , is assigned to investigate Vik's death, he becomes worried about ballistic fingerprinting and tampers with evidence to support his story. Haunted by guilt and unable to sleep with the midnight sun of the Arctic, Engstr\u00f6m becomes increasingly unhinged and starts hallucinating about Vik. Things become even worse when he learns that Tanja's murderer saw him shoot Vik. Engstr\u00f6m learns from one of Tanja's friends that she has been seeing Jon Holt , a crime novelist. He correctly deduces that Holt killed Tanja, but Holt blackmails Engstr\u00f6m with his knowledge of the Vik shooting. The two meet and decide to frame Tanja's boyfriend Eilert for her murder, with Engstr\u00f6m later planting Holt's gun under Eilert's bed. However, Hagen is not convinced of Eilert's involvement, and when new evidence emerges, Engstr\u00f6m knows that it's only a matter of time before Holt is arrested. Engstr\u00f6m tracks down Holt in the ruins at a waterfront and tries to talk with him. Holt suspects that Engstr\u00f6m has come to kill him and holds him at gunpoint. He explains how he killed Tanja in a fit of rage when she rejected his advances. Holt tries to flee across a pier, but the rotten floorboards give way and he falls into the water below. He hits his head and drowns, while Engstr\u00f6m looks on. When he rummages through Holt's nearby house, Engstr\u00f6m finds Tanja's dress, which Holt removed before dumping the body. With Holt dead, and having found definitive proof that he was the murderer, the case is closed. Just before he leaves town, Engstr\u00f6m is visited by Hagen, who shows him a cartridge case found at the site where Vik was shot. She notes that it is a Norma case, which Engstr\u00f6m confirms is a brand used by the Swedish police. Engstr\u00f6m expects Hagen to arrest him, but she instead lets him off the hook and she leaves the cartridge case. However, when Engstr\u00f6m is driving off, his face is weary, so are his eyes, suggesting that he didn't recover from the sleeping disorder.\n"}
