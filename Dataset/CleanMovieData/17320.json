Hushpuppy listens to animal heartbeats and states that all living things have a heartbeat, and they all speak in a language she cannot understand, but she believes they\u2019re just hungry. Hushpuppy rides a makeshift raft with Wink and looks at the factories in the distance that are behind a levee. Hushpuppy, her father, and the inhabitants in the Bathtub, a place beyond the levee, have more holidays where people play various instruments and scream in raucous celebration, although separated from the rest of society. However, a storm is approaching and Hushpuppy thinks that Bathtub will be destroyed but she stays to be joyous as long as she\u2019s with Wink. A local teacher, Miss Bathsheba  lectures several children, including Hushpuppy and points out a tattoo on her thigh that depicts cavemen and beasts called \u201cAurochs\u201d. The Aurochs are relentless creatures and devour humans but Hushpuppy explains that one day the ice age came and all the Aurochs are frozen now. However, Miss Bathsheba explains that ice caps will melt, and the Bathtub washed away and tells the children they all have to learn how to survive and take care of one another. Hushpuppy returns home and waits for Wink but she arrives late and she makes dinner all by herself. She ponders on the whereabouts of her mother and how she would have a beautiful voice. Wink arrives home dressed in hospital clothing  and yells at her to go home. Angered, Hushpuppy heads home and turns up the stove. As the stove explodes, a fire starts in her home and she hides in a box. Wink comes into Hushpuppy\u2019s home  screaming and trying to find her before their house burns down. Hushpuppy runs out where she is chased by Wink. He catches her and screams at Hushpuppy, but she is defiant and stubborn. Wink slaps her and she falls to the ground. Hushpuppy gets up and curses and punches Wink, to which he falls to the ground. Hushpuppy hears a storm coming. Meanwhile, the scene shifts to that of the Arctic, where a piece of the ice shelf falls into the ocean. Inside the piece that fell off, is an Auroch . Hushpuppy chances upon Miss Bathsheba, who makes some kind of herbal medicine and instructs her to quickly give it to Wink. She returns home and hides the medicine since Wink has left. The next day, many people seem to be preparing to leave, packing their belongings in their trucks, due to the incoming storm. Throughout the film, it is implied that Wink has had alcohol with him and it\u2019s clear that he is an alcoholic. The two head home and divides the house with tape, where Wink tells Hushpuppy not to mind about the storm. Wink, in a effort to make Hushpuppy less worried, attempts to \u201cscare\u201d the storm by shooting at the clouds. The storm has devastated the Bathtub where everywhere is flooded and most of the houses are destroyed. The two sail off in their boat and look for other people. While Wink is searching inside a house, he realizes Hushpuppy is hungry. He then tries to teach her how to catch a fish with her hands, where he tells her to punch the fish\u2019s head really hard, but she looks hesitant. Wink tells Hushpuppy about her mother on how pretty she is and in one incident how she killed an alligator that crept up to him. Luckily, Hushpuppy\u2019s mom came by and shot the alligator. The next day, Wink sails off in search of other children. Hushpuppy states that there are several people that are probably dead and they would hold a Bathtub-style funeral, where no crying is allowed. She also states that the universe is comprised of several tiny pieces and as soon as one of those pieces falls apart, the universe unravels. Hushpuppy is being taught how to crack open a crab with a knife but Wink tells her to stop. Wink then grabs the crab, breaks it with his hands, and eats some of it. He then tells Hushpuppy to \u201cBeast it,\"  Eventually the whole group is chanting \u201cBeast it!\u201d where Hushpuppy tears open the crab and gets cheered on by everyone in the bar. The remaining residents form a community by fixing and binding a few houses together. Many wonder if it\u2019s time to leave the area but Miss Bathsheba states that the people on the other side of the levee will just put them in a shelter. They also all realize everything is going to die soon since the area is flooded with salt water. This community continues until one day when Hushpuppy wakes up and sees Wink and two of his friends with a dead alligator and getting ready to sail off. Wink comes over to Hushpuppy and tells her that he\u2019s going to get everything back to normal. Wink and his friends sail off, and we see what their plan is. Wink sticks some dynamite inside the alligator\u2019s mouth and hands the trip wire to one of his friends. They sail up to the levee and plant the alligator bomb at the wall. Unfortunately, Wink\u2019s friend lost the trip wire, and it\u2019s somewhere in the water. While all of this is occurring, Miss Bathsheba wakes up and realizes something is wrong since the three men are gone. She quickly gets in her boat and sails off. Unknown to her though, Hushpuppy snuck into her boat and is hiding under a pile of net. Miss Bathsheba sails up to Wink and his friends and finds the trip wire. She yells at Wink for his plan and throws the trip wire aside. Hushpuppy quickly grabs it and emerges from the net. Everybody freezes as Hushpuppy holds the trip wire. Miss Bathsheba tells her not to do anything but Wink tells her to pull it. Hushpuppy pulls it, and the wall of the levee falls apart. The water drains from the bathtub and everybone goes on with their lives, although the Bathtub is not the same as the way it was before. When Wink is asleep, Hushpuppy notices that he shudders when he is asleep and is obviously sick. She grabs for the medicine she\u2019d hidden and puts it on Wink\u2019s mouth, where he spits the it out. He gets up and breaks the jar containing the medicine. In frustration, Hushpuppy then starts throwing things, as well. In response, Wink begins to throw more things. Then they eventually start to have fun and throw stuff at each other. Later, Wink has to lie down from his sickness where Hushpuppy asks if he is going to die. He states that he isn\u2019t going to die yet, whenever it happens, she would need to fend for herself. She\u2019ll have to be leader and perhaps the last resident of the Bathtub. After letting Hushpuppy win an arm wrestling match, he tells her to be the \u201cman\u201d. The two then fall asleep together as Hushpuppy lays on Wink\u2019s chest, listening to his heartbeat. On the other hand, the Aurochs have started to approach. They are big and strong enough to plow through buildings and Hushpuppy states that they are ruthless enough to eat their own parents when they\u2019re hungry. The next day, however, a number of men have arrived at the Bathtub and tells all the residents that they need to be evacuated in a shelter. While they are being taken care of, a doctor comes up and tells Wink his condition is serious. Wink yells at him and tells the doctor not to say this in front of Hushpuppy. While Wink and the doctor talk farther away, Hushpuppy overheard some of their conversation such as Wink who\u2019s gonna die if he does not get the surgery. After Wink\u2019s surgery, we see him trying to get out of bed, but the doctors won\u2019t let him. They give him some pills and he goes to sleep with Hushpuppy watching. After the doctors leave, Wink spits out the pills and gets out of bed. He tells Hushpuppy that they are leaving. It turns out the residents of the Bathtub have been planning an escape for a while. The residents get out of the shelter and get on a bus while Wink gets left out. Hushpuppy tells then to stop and she runs out to her father where Wink tells her that he is going to die where Hushpuppy cries. Wink admits to her that he\u2019s going to die and that he can\u2019t take care of her anymore. Wink eventually gives in and goes back to the Bathtub with the others while coughing up blood. Meanwhile, Hushpuppy, along with her friends, swim towards the light in the distance where Hushpuppy thinks her mom is but is eventually get picked up by a boat. They eventually arrive on a club and are greeted by several women. Hushpuppy chances upon a woman who thinks is her mom. The woman then leads Hushpuppy to a back room and begins to cook some alligator. Hushpuppy remembers in the past when her mom made her alligator. While the woman is cooking, she tells Hushpuppy that one day she\u2019s going to have to stand up for herself. The woman then hands the alligator dish to Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy tells the woman that she wants to stay with her and bring her, but doesn\u2019t know anything about him, although the woman tells her she is always welcome to stay with. Hushpuppy and the girls arrive back at the Bathtub comes face to face with the Aurochs, who have also arrived, as well. The Aurochs starts chasing them but Hushpuppy remains intact. When one Auroch gets close to her, she turns around and stares at it. Suddenly, all the Aurochs stop. Hushpuppy and the Auroch stare at each other for a while and Hushpuppy remarks that she thinks the Auroch is her \u201cfriend\u201d. The Aurochs soon flee making Hushpuppy realize that she has to \u201ctake care of her own\". Hushpuppy goes home to see Wink, who is getting worse. She feeds him the alligator dish the woman had given her and remarks that it\u2019s good. The two begin to cry where he tells her not to cry. Hushpuppy cries more as she puts her head on his chest and listen to his last heartbeats as Wink dies. Hushpuppy places Wink\u2019s body in their boat and setting it on fire along with other residents of the Bathtub who are saddened by Wink\u2019s death. Next, Hushpuppy leads a group in the Bathtub, walking down a road.
