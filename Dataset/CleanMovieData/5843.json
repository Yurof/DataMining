However, recently Alex has stopped taking her medication. Alex's parents moved with her from Argentina to a village by the sea in Uruguay, to avoid society's negative stigma. Her father, N\u00e9stor Kraken , is a marine biologist who has written a book on sexuality and makes a living treating wounded animals found by fishermen. Her mother, Suli , invites friends from Argentina: a surgeon, his wife and teenage son \u00c1lvaro . The purpose, unknown to N\u00e9stor and Alex, is to discuss the possibilities of a gender reassignment operation. Alex directly tells \u00c1lvaro that she would like to have sex with him. Alex seduces \u00c1lvaro and begins to have anal intercourse with him , but they are interrupted when N\u00e9stor catches sight of them through an open door. When Alex later apologizes, \u00c1lvaro admits that he liked it. Three boys from the village forcibly pull down Alex's pants to see her genitals. N\u00e9stor realizes that reporting this to the police would cause the whole village to know about Alex's condition. However, Alex decides that it does not matter. Alex also decides that she does not want to resume taking medicines or have an operation.\n"}
