A young woman at the front of the boat, clearly distraught for some reason, accidentally drops a bundle into the water, which Daigoro retrieves. Itt\u014d, meanwhile, draws his sword part way and notices in the reflection on the blade that some bamboo reeds are also trailing the boat. Itt\u014d is being followed by operatives of his mortal enemy, the Yagy\u016b Clan \u2013 a constant threat that he can never ignore. Later, as Daigoro is relieving himself in a bamboo glade, Itt\u014d slices some bamboo stalks, causing some ninja to fall from their perch. This is a time when there are ronin, or at the very least a low-class of samurai termed watari-kashi \u2013 small bands of fighters who move from job to job, working from one daimyo to the next, depending on who's hiring. A group of four watari-kashi are idling along the road. Hot and bored, they spy an attractive young woman and her mother being escorted by a servant. Three of them run off to take advantage, but one of the band \u2013 Kanbei, the more honorable of the four \u2013 remains uninterested. The three knock the escort unconscious and proceed to rape the two women. The servant regains consciousness and is furious when he sees the triad violating his mistresses. He attempts to beat them with his bamboo pole, but is slain by Kanbei, who then also slays the two women to silence them. Kanbei then makes his three companions draw straws, saying the one unfortunate enough to draw the short straw will be killed to take the blame for the rapes and murders. Itt\u014d happens along this grim scene just as Kanbei is slaying the watari-kashi who drew the short straw. Itt\u014d kills the other two rapists when they attempt to attack him. Kanbei recognizes Itt\u014d and requests a duel. Itt\u014d accepts and they prepare, but at the last second Itt\u014d re-sheathes his sword and calls it a draw, leaving Kanbei to ponder his fate alone. \"You are a true warrior,\" Itt\u014d says, \"One I hope lives on.\" At an inn, it turns out that the young woman from the boat is to be sold into prostitution. Her pimp tries to have his way with her, but she bites off his tongue, spitting the bloody appendage onto the floor. The pimp dies from the injury. The girl seeks refuge in Itt\u014d's room, who steps in to protect her from the local police. But then the town's real authorities show up \u2013 the yakuza, led by a woman named Torizo. After some verbal sparring and defending himself against Torizo's pistol, Itt\u014d agrees to act as a substitute for the young woman and undergo buri-buri, a form of torture that involves the subject being hogtied and hung in the air and repeatedly dunked headfirst into a tub of water. The subject is then beaten to unconsciousness by men wielding thick rattan canes and shouting \"buri-buri\". Itt\u014d endures the torture with his typical stoicism. This frees the young woman from having work as a prostitute. Itt\u014d, still with a debt to pay for the death of the pimp, agrees to take on an assassination for Torizo and her father, a one-armed man that Itt\u014d is acquainted with from his past life as the shogun's executioner - acting as second during the execution of a daimyo who, fear-stricken, struggled dishonourably; Torizo's father had restrained the daimyo, sacrificing his arm to Itt\u014d's killing stroke. The target is a corrupt district deputy. Initially Itt\u014d is to face the deputy's personal bodyguards, one of whom is a sharpshooter and quick-draw artist who wields a pair of revolvers. Through cunning and guile , Itt\u014d defeats the armed man and takes his guns. The other is defeated by Itt\u014d in a sword duel. Itt\u014d's battle culminates in his facing the deputy's army \u2013 perhaps 200 men \u2013 singlehandedly. For the first time, the true power of the baby cart is revealed as it proves to harbor an entire arsenal of weapons, including spears, daggers, a bullet-proof shield, and a small battery of guns, capable of taking out many enemy soldiers like a heavy machine gun. All of the deputy's men are killed as Itt\u014d first takes out half of them with the baby cart's machine gun, and then takes out the rest with his sword and other weapons from the baby cart. The deputy is the last to fall when Itt\u014d, deprived of his sword when it falls out of his hands when he falls down an embankment, takes out one of the pistols he took earlier from the deputy bodyguard and uses it to shoot and kill the deputy. Itt\u014d then discards the gun and reclaims his sword, mumbling to himself that firearms are so uncivilized. Word of the fight has been passed to neighboring districts, and the ronin Kanbei shows up just after Itt\u014d has slain the deputy, and makes his demand again for a duel. Though battle-weary, Itt\u014d accepts the challenge. The fight is over in an instant. Itt\u014d is sliced across his back, but Kanbei is mortally wounded, impaled on Itt\u014d's Dotanuki battle sword. As Kanbei kneels to the ground, dying, he tells Itt\u014d his story and why he became a ronin \u2013 a tale involving an ambush on his master's convoy. Seeing his side outnumbered, Kanbei seized an opportunity and ran ahead to attack the enemy head on. He surprised the enemy and prevailed in deflecting the hostiles, and saved the lord's life as a result, but since he left his lord's side, he was dishonored and expelled from the clan. He questions Itt\u014d whether he had done the wrong thing, and whether being a samurai means to fight and live, or to simply never leave the master's side and die. Itt\u014d replied that he would have done the same. \"I am glad to hear that,\" Kanbei says, who then asks the former shogun's executioner to act as his \"second\" in the act of seppuku. This Itt\u014d does with honor. When asked by Kanbei what is the true \"Way of the Warrior\", Itt\u014d replies that it is neither to simply live nor die, but to live through death. As Itt\u014d walks away and Torizo begins to runs after him, but is stopped by her men. They implore her not to go to him, saying he is not human, but a monster.\n"}
