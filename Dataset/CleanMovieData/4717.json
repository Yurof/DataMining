He is permanently opposed by competitors. When his brother start seeking a girl as his bride, he opines that he should select his future bride. He selects Gowri, daughter of an auditor who is working with Pampathy. Pampathy\u2019s younger brother is Home Minister and Pampathy\u2019s son is a vagabond womanizer. To gain her approval, Basava makes every effort, but before he can get her green signal, her engagement is fixed with the vagabond son of Pampathy. Supported by Gowri\u2019s peppy and naughty grandmother , Basava rises against the autocratic behaviour of Pampathy, challenges him in public, and wins, thereby also winning the heart and hand of Gowri.\n"}
