Pierre's father  dies early in the movie, leaving his mother, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne  to care for him. Pierre soon learns, however, of the depraved nature of his parents. While in a restaurant, his mother reveals to him that she has been unfaithful to her husband many times with his knowledge and feels no shame about it. She then insists that her son accepts her promiscuous ways. Soon after this, Pierre finds a closet full of his father's pornography. His reaction is to furiously masturbate and then to urinate on the magazine pages. However, there are several far more shocking surprises in store for Pierre. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne encourages her uninhibited sex buddy, R\u00e9a , to take her son's virginity. She does so but in public and on a concrete floor at Gran Canaria's Yumbo Centrum, a popular shopping and nightlife complex. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne looks on longingly as the partially clothed couple copulates with passersby raising no objections. Afterwards, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne includes her son in an orgy with her friends, including Hansi , a sweet-faced young woman who later becomes Pierre's girlfriend. After the orgy, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne decides that she must leave her son to travel. While saying goodbye to Pierre, she implies that something taboo has happened between them and that she must leave to prevent it from happening again. Upon H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's departure, Hansi enters Pierre's life as a friend. She admits befriending Pierre at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's encouragement but denies receiving a fee from her. Their friendship blossoms into a tender romance and they both fall in love. During their relationship, Hansi reveals that she has participated in sado-masochistic sex many times as a dominatrix with her friend Loulou  as the willing masochist. She adds H\u00e9l\u00e8ne arranged these encounters as sexual exhibitions for tourists. After an extended absence from the movie, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne returns home with R\u00e9a in tow because H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has finally tired of her sexual adventures. Upon arriving, she finds her son and Hansi socializing at a bar near the villa. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Pierre greet each other by chatting and gazing into each other's eyes like lovers while Hansi looks on jealously. Finally, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne invites her son to sleep with her. He agrees. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Pierre go into the wine cellar of the house. They begin to act out their desires physically. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne asks her son to cut her abdomen with a razor while he masturbates and as he climaxes she slits her own throat. The next scene is the paramedics carting away H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's body. Afterwards Pierre wanders the beach where he meets a middleaged woman whom he asks to accompany him to view his mother's body. The son is allowed to say his good-bye before the cremation. When he is allowed to say his goodbye, he goes in the room and begins to masturbate himself exclaiming that he does not want to die...\n"}
