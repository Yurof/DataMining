The President of France orders the case be considered of utmost urgency by the National Police, only for it to be handed down to the bumbling Inspector L\u00e9once Caponi. Ad\u00e8le Blanc-Sec, a journalist and travel writer of some fame, finds herself involved after returning from Egypt, where she was searching for Ramesses II's mummified doctor. She wants to revive the mummy with the help of Esp\u00e9randieu so the doctor can save her sister Agathe, who is comatose following an unfortunate tennis incident involving a hatpin. After a brief struggle with her arch nemesis, the mysterious Professor Dieuleveut, she retrieves the mummy and returns home. Her mission is complicated further by Esperandiue being on death row, having been blamed for the pterosaur's attacks in lieu of Inspector Caponi and celebrity big game hunter Justin de Saint-Hubert having any success in taking down the beast itself. The mummy ends up being the Pharaoh's Nuclear physicist  and is unable to help her sister medically. He does, however, accompany Ad\u00e8le to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, where they revive the rest of the Pharaoh's mummified court on display there, including the Pharaoh himself. The Pharaoh's doctor uses their advanced medical techniques to revive Agathe. The Pharaoh then decides he wants to see Paris, so the entire court wanders out into the night, scaring the ever-hapless Choupard yet again. Ad\u00e8le decides she needs a vacation to relax. The final scene shows her boarding a ship, only to be annoyed by some boisterous children. Professor Dieuleveut appears, as the viewpoint pulls back the name of the ship is revealed, the RMS Titanic.\n"}
