{"wikiId": "5150992", "titre": "When the Cat's Away", "dateSortie": "1996-04-03", "duree": "90.0", "genre": ["Romance Film", "Comedy"], "resume": "This is the story of a young woman living in Paris, and more particularly in the Bastille neighborhood, who has lost her cat. Through the pursuit of the cat, the film allows the spectator to discover the contrasts of the district, which is evolving from a typical Parisian district to a modern and young district, and the contrast between its inhabitants, among them a nice simpleton and the old women who are bored. In fact it\u2019s the story of a village in a large city and C\u00e9dric Klapisch shows once again the behaviour of one individual inside a group, as he did it in Le p\u00e9ril jeune or Riens du tout. This time he has succeeded in joining together actors, theatre actors and residents of the district, creating a credible atmosphere and that is probably the reason for the success of this film outside France.\n"}
