Watt enlists the help of Holmes after his assistant is attacked. Scotland Yard detective Lestrade also arrives after the first in a series of murders which seem to be tied up with an ancient and apparently meaningless family ritual. Holmes investigates, and discovers that the ritual points to the hiding-place of a land grant, which would make the owner fabulously wealthy. Holmes finally confronts the killer in the crypt in the Manor, and although held at gunpoint, manages to elicit a confession and turn him over to the police.Davies, David Stuart, Holmes of the Movies  ISBN 450 03358 9\n"}
