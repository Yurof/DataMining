Accompanied by his assistant's assistant, Lutz , he travels to the United States to become \"the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler\". Br\u00fcno unsuccessfully attempts an acting career as an extra on NBC's Medium. He then interviews Paula Abdul, using \"Mexican chair-people\" in place of furniture . He then produces a celebrity interview pilot, showing him dancing erotically, criticizing Jamie-Lynn Spears' fetus with reality TV star Brittny Gastineau, unsuccessfully attempting to \u201cinterview\" actor Harrison Ford, and closing with a close-up of his penis being swung around by pelvic gyrations. A focus group reviewing the pilot hate it, calling it \"worse than cancer\". Br\u00fcno then decides to make a sex tape, so he interviews Ron Paul, claiming to have mistaken him for drag queen RuPaul. While waiting in a hotel room with Paul, Br\u00fcno flirts with him before undressing, causing Paul to leave angrily and call him \"queer as blazes\". Br\u00fcno consults a spiritualist  to contact the deceased Rob Pilatus of Milli Vanilli for advice, miming various sex acts on the invisible \"Pilatus\". He consults charity PR consultants Nicole and Suzanne DeFosset to select a world problem to maximize his fame, choosing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He flies to Jerusalem to interview former Mossad agent Yossi Alpher and Palestinian politician Ghassan Khatib and confuses hummus and Hamas. In an interview with Israeli and Palestinian professors he sings his own \"Dove of Peace\" while forcing the two to caress each others hands. He also meets with Ayman Abu Aita, a \"terrorist group leader, Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades\" in a location described as a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, where he hopes to be kidnapped.The actual location, according to Abu Aita, was a private section of a popular restaurant at the [http://www.palestinehotels.ps/hotel.php?hidhttp://www.co.madison.al.us/courts/courts/release.shtml |titleCo.madison.al.us |date2011-02-09}} after being arrested. Lutz says he loves Br\u00fcno but Br\u00fcno tells him he does not love him, having been influenced by \"carb goggles\". Lutz leaves Br\u00fcno. After realizing the biggest names in Hollywood are straight , Br\u00fcno consults two Christian gay converters to help him become heterosexual. He attempts activities, such as joining the National Guard, going hunting in Alabama, learning karate and attending a swingers party at which he is whipped by a dominatrix . These attempts end miserably due to Br\u00fcno's failure to keep his gay traits hidden, but he vows to become straight. Eight months later, a now-heterosexual Br\u00fcno, under the alias \"Straight Dave\", hosts a cage-fight match in Arkansas, \"Straight Dave's Man Slammin' Maxout\". Lutz appears at the event and calls Br\u00fcno a faggot. The two fight, only to rekindle their love, making out and stripping in front of the shocked spectators who throw objects into the cage. The clip gets international press and the now-famous Br\u00fcno attempts to marry Lutz and gets O.J. back in exchange for a MacBook Pro. Br\u00fcno records a charity song, \"Dove of Peace\", featuring Bono, Elton John , Chris Martin, Snoop Dogg, Sting and Slash at Abbey Road Studios.\n"}
