Catherine decides to make an overture of goodwill by offering up her daughter Margot  in marriage to Henri de Bourbon , a prominent Huguenot and King of Navarre, although she also schemes to bring about the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572, when thousands of Protestants are slaughtered. The marriage goes forward but Margot, who does not love Henri, begins a passionate affair with the soldier La M\u00f4le , also a Protestant from a well-to-do family. Murders by poisoning follow, as court intrigues multiply and Queen Catherine's villainous plotting to place her son the Duke of Anjou  on the throne threatens the lives of La M\u00f4le, Margot and Henri of Navarre. A book with pages painted with arsenic is intended for Henri but instead causes the slow, agonizing death of King Charles. Henri escapes to Navarre and sends La M\u00f4le to fetch Margot, but Guise apprehends him. La M\u00f4le is beheaded in the Bastille before Margot can save him, and King Charles finally dies. Margot escapes carrying La M\u00f4le's embalmed head as Anjou is proclaimed King of France as Henry III.\n"}
