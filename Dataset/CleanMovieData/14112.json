He tries many, but is always fired soon. Finally he gets a job as \"half-boss\" in the company led by his cousin, after he points out that they inherited this company together from their grandfather. When Japanese business relations, to his cousin's regret, refuse to sign a contract, \u0130vedik happens to wear a jacket of some organisation the Japanese are a member of, which makes them think he is the boss of that organisation; this and \u0130vedik's pressure on them convinces them to sign the contract after all. This makes his cousin very satisfied about him. \u0130vedik's grandmother also wants him to get married. He tries to find a woman with the assistance of a young worker of the company, Ali Kerem . They do not succeed, but Kerem helps \u0130vedik by disguising as a woman and accompanying him to his grandmother, where they pretend they are in love. \u0130vedik's grandmother dies. He inherits a chest which only contains a photograph of her making a \"fuck-you\"-gesture.\n"}
