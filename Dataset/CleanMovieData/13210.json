{"wikiId": "14213745", "titre": "She Grazed Horses on Concrete", "dateSortie": "1982", "duree": "78.0", "genre": ["Romance Film", "Drama", "Comedy"], "resume": "Johanka  had a fling with a well-digger  she had not met before and who, she was most likely certain, would never be around again. About 18 years later, she is a single woman respected and recognized at the local co-op farm where she works \u2212 except that it does not translate to the same compensation for her as for the male workers \u2212 who keeps turning down her lifelong suitor, friend and neighbor Berty . Her 18-year-old daughter Paul\u00edna  commutes by bus to work in the nearby city, which gives the village gossips the occasional opportunity to remind her of her unknown father. A resultant conflict with her mother makes Paul\u00edna take up residence in the city. Johanka, prodded by her also-single friend Jozefka  who maintains that a woman without a man is nothing, begins to woo the new teacher Jarek  only to discover later that he is married. Paul\u00edna, in the meantime, loses her virginity to the soldier Jirka  who promptly makes himself scarce. Johanka fails to consider that she actually has a better life than some of her married neighbors, begins to see abortion or marriage as Paul\u00edna's only options, and places personals on her behalf. Although \u0160tefan , one of the men who respond, turns out to be less than ideal, Paul\u00edna falls for him. As \u0160tefan's car breaks down on the way to the elaborate wedding party and the cake adorned with a doll he is bringing begins to melt in the heat, Paul\u00edna, in her wedding dress and tipsy before the ceremony, suffers miscarriage, perhaps as a result of Johanka's earlier attempt to induce abortion that would look as if it occurred spontaneously. The car that carries Paul\u00edna to the hospital passes \u0160tefan's car towed by a farm tractor, but none of the involved notice.\n"}
