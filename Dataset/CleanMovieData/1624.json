But when his daughter dies of starvation, Sooyoung is driven by his outrage to vandalize the large propaganda posters that decorate the town with happy, assuring slogans. Hoping to inspire change, Sooyoung risks his life to deface the billboards, repainting the messages to reflect a more truthful take on contemporary North Korea. He manages to avoid capture by the newly formed \u201cAnti-Graffiti\u201d patrol, but when he sees that his act of protest leads to the arrest of local innocents, he must question to what end do his rebellious actions really serve. Will Sooyoung continue his campaign of revolution or will the government silence another individual voice? Original, controversial and painstakingly researched, DEFACE sheds light on the Hermit Nation through dramatic storytelling, amazing performances and compelling imagery.\n"}
