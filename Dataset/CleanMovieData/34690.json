Kelly, , and his pal Happy Moran, , are taking their all-girl-dancing troupe across the ocean to tour Europe, when Kelly and the mysterious Catherine Bell, , fall for each other, literally.

As a crooner, Kelly tries to sell enough mops, with a radio show, to pull the kingdom out of bankruptcy, and win Princess Tania, , the mysterious Catherine Bell, from their shipboard romance. Time is running out, as Prince Alexis, , invades, from the neighbouring country, to seize the castle and marry the Princess. Their only defence is the women and their \u201cPersonality Mops\u201d, when the army quits, over back wages; and, Kelly is being marched off in front of a Firing Squad. \u201cMake Love not War\u201d, could be their slogan, as the women all march to the castle, singing and waving their mops.\n"}
