Now played by Charles Solomon , who would take on the role for the next two parts in the series, William's last name has been changed to Adams. It turns out that William\u2019s parents were involved in a coven that was all set to kill baby William in order to bring Satan to Earth. They couldn\u2019t bear to see it happen, so they took William and ran. Now William, who doesn\u2019t realize his power, has to deal with his witch-temptress-neighbor by the name of Dolores Jones. Delores, however, is actually Elizabeth Churchill, the evil witch from the first film, who has whipped up a spell that turns her into the voluptuous middle-aged neighbor.\n"}
