The film opens as a wealthy businessman, Servet, running a campaign for the upcoming election, is driving in his car alone and sleepy, struggling to keep his eyes open. Seconds later he hits and kills a pedestrian in the middle of the road. Servet panics when another car with a couple inside approaches. He sneaks away. Ey\u00fcp, a man living in a slum at the Yedikule neighborhood in \u0130stanbul, with his wife and only son, is the driver of Servet. He wakes up in the middle of the night with his cell phone ringing. It's his boss, telling Ey\u00fcp to meet him immediately. Shivering in shock, Servet explains the current events to his driver. His excuse is if the fatal accident comes out in press it would terminate his political career, so he proposes Ey\u00fcp to take over the penalty and stay in prison for a brief period of time in exchange for a lump sum payment upon his release, whilst still paying his salary to his family so they can get by. Ey\u00fcp accepts the deal. An unspecified time passes, summer arrives, and Ey\u00fcp's son \u0130smail fails to enter college again. His mother, Hacer, who works in the catering division of a factory, starts worrying about her son after unpleasant events, and tries to convince him to get a job. \u0130smail suggests driving children between home and school but of course they don't have any financial source for this kind of an enterprise. \u0130smail asks his mother to request an advance payment from Servet without consulting Ey\u00fcp. Hacer meets with Servet, in his office after the election , and requests the money. After Hacer leaves the office and starts waiting for a bus at the stop Servet persuades Hacer to accept a lift from him back to her home. More unspecified time passes, and \u0130smail intends to visit his father. Things take a poor turn when he finds his mother having an affair with Servet. \u0130smail stands passive. After serving nine months in prison, Ey\u00fcp is released. He senses things are \"a little peculiar\" inside his home. Hacer is in love with Servet and insists on maintaining their affair. Servet disagrees. That night, Hacer and Ey\u00fcp are invited to the police station and informed that Servet has been murdered. Police officers interrogate the two and Ey\u00fcp finds out that Hacer was cheating on him. He denies knowing anything about it. \u0130smail confesses to his mother that he murdered Servet. Ey\u00fcp calms down when he pays a visit to a mosque. Afterwards, Ey\u00fcp goes on to speak with a very poor man who works and sleeps inside a tea house in the neighborhood. Ey\u00fcp makes the same proposition to the poor man, Bayram, that Servet made to him: to claim the crime committed by his son. Bayram agrees. The last scene shows Ey\u00fcp at his home's balcony, staring at the Sea of Marmara, and along with thunder it starts to rain.\n"}
