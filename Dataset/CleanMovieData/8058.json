{"wikiId": "25080990", "titre": "The Spy in the Green Hat", "dateSortie": "1967-02-03", "duree": "92.0", "genre": ["Thriller", "Crime Fiction", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Action", "Spy"], "resume": "Solo and Kuryakin are assigned to infiltrate a THRUSH secret base located in a Sicillian winery. The base is run by Louis Strago, who in conjunction with former Nazi Dr. von Kronen is planning to detonate atomic bombs in the Atlantic Ocean. The bombs will cause the Gulf Stream to divert, wrecking havoc in Europe and the United States and warming Greenland sufficiently for it to become a strategic new home for THRUSH . The agents are split up after an encounter with THRUSH, with Solo having to hide overnight in the house of Pia Monteri. When Pia\u2019s grandmother learns of this, she considers it a disgrace to her family\u2019s reputation  and insists at the end of a shotgun that Solo marry Pia. Solo manages to escape, but Pia and her grandmother enlist the aid of Pia's uncles to find him and return him for marriage. Her uncles are the Stilleto brothers, Prohibition era gangsters in the U.S. who miss the \"good old days\". Solo barely escapes the wedding. Kuryakin and, ultimately, Pia are captured by Strago and taken to his island base from which the bombs will be launched. Tortured by Miss Diketon , Kuryakin is to be executed at a party held for Strago\u2019s immediate superior in THRUSH, Mr. Thaler. U.N.C.L.E. learns of the plot thanks to Solo\u2019s efforts and sends an assault force to bomb the island, killing everyone on it. With Mr. Waverly\u2019s reluctant approval, Solo attempts a rescue of Kuryakin and Pia before the bombers attack. Strago\u2019s defenses prove too much, however, and Solo finds himself allied with the Stilleto brothers - who have come to the island as well in search of Pia. Miss Diketon betrays Strago due to his dismissal of her over a minor error, and with her help U.N.C.L.E. and the Stilletos are able to stop the missile launch. Strago, Thaler, and von Kronen are killed in the process. Diketon also dies in the fight, enjoying both the physical pain she is feeling and the fact that she saw Strago\u2019s plan fail. Pia\u2019s family finally stops trying to get Solo to marry her, and the film ends with everyone enjoying an Italian dinner.\n"}
