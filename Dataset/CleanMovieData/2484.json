Unfortunately they have no experience whatsoever and after shooting their cameraman after a misunderstanding, soon find themselves in a life and death race against a cocky gay  Norwegian team led by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd. Providing logistical support from the UK HQ  are Brian's wife, Sandra, and Mark's second best friend, Graham, a keen CB radio enthusiast. The documentary director, played by Helen Baxendale, does her best to make sure no one actually dies during the making of the documentary, but is way out of her depth.\n"}
