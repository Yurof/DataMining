It then flashes back to the beginning, showing Keiichir\u014d taking shelter from the rain near a trash heap next to which a small girl is sitting in a chair with a sunflower, unconscious. After second thoughts he decides to pick her up and takes her to a technical specialist. The scene reveals that the girl is an older model of a popular line of service androids, called Parents, who is broken. Because she is an older model, the specialist says she cannot be fixed, and provides Keiichir\u014d with the necessary sticker to dispose of her. Keiichir\u014d leaves her among some junk in his house before going to sleep, intending to throw her out the following day. During the night, the girl begins functioning and finds herself in a strange house with no memory of the past. When Keiichir\u014d comes downstairs the following morning, he finds her preparing breakfast. He names her Flower after the sunflower she was holding when he found her. It is revealed that evening, when Flower prepares the same meal for dinner as she had for breakfast, that Flower suffers from short-term memory loss, so Keiichir\u014d buys her a diary which is used as the primary means of narration in the OVA. Over the next several weeks Keiichir\u014d begins to teach her about the world, and more indirectly about himself and his troubled past.\n"}
