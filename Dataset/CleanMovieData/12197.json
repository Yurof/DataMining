An inquisitive girl named   chances upon Cenco at school when it is transformed into a bicycle. After Tetsu arrives to retrieve the bicycle, Yuki inadvertently causes Cenco to transform back into its normally large form by poking it in the eye. Yuki is much more interested in Cenco than Tetsu and accompanies them into town. There, a boy named  , who controls two of the creatures, confronts Tetsu in order to obtain Cenco. Tetsu manages to fend off Sh\u016b's attacks while also protecting Yuki, and they leave while Sh\u016b's creature is incapacitated. Sh\u016b confronts Yuki later that day and gets her to tell Tetsu to meet and fight Sh\u016b again. The following day, Sh\u016b takes Yuki hostage to force Tetsu to come, and places her on a ledge of a tall building. After Tetsu arrives, Sh\u016b attacks from afar and manages to cut off one of Cenco's arms. To repair the arm, Cenco removes one of Tetsu's arms, which incapacitates him momentarily. Sh\u016b arrives with a much larger creature and Cenco takes Yuki within its body where Tetsu already is. Yuki gets Cenco to change control of it from Tetsu to herself, and after Sh\u016b's larger creature eats Cenco along with Yuki, she manages to take control of the larger creature as well. They are subsequently attacked by the military with tanks and missiles, but are protected for the time being when Tetsu changes the creature's shape to that of a massive walnut. Tetsu and Yuki are separated and Sh\u016b attempts to take control back from Yuki, but he cannot control the creature anymore and severs the link, effectively killing it. Tetsu makes it back with Cenco to where Yuki and Sh\u016b are, and Yuki knocks Sh\u016b out with Cenco transformed into a baseball bat. Afterwards, Yuki transforms Cenco into Tetsu's lost arm, which gives him back control of his limb. Sh\u016b is later shown having been rescued by his other creature.\n"}
