Mich\u00e8le had just recently broken up with her boyfriend so she meets up with some of her friends at a caf\u00e9. It is there that she meets the charming veterinarian Fran\u00e7ois. Though Mich\u00e8le has a promising modeling career, she feels that something, or someone, is missing in her life. Fran\u00e7ois quickly fills this void, and Mich\u00e8le feels partially whole. She first claims that she is Catholic but is dissatisfied with the results of praying and worshipping. By recommendation, she begins to follow Buddhism through meditation and use of elaborate costume jewelry. Eventually, she discovers that Fran\u00e7ois is Jewish; however, he does not practice his faith. Throughout the film, she immerses herself in Judaism, following traditions such as the Sabbath. Fran\u00e7ois breaks up with her by telling her \"your touch sickens me\", after accusing her of lying. He then engages in several other affairs but fails to ever marry. She attempts to date a few men but does not create any true connections. Finally, at a wedding of their friend Val\u00e9rie, Francois has broken up with yet another woman and claims to desire her. The movie ends with the famous line, \"...to be continued\" leaving viewers curious about their future.\n"}
