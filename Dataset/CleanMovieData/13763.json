When Mar\u00eda falls ill with malaria, Don Damian refuses to give the couple the quinine medicine necessary to fight the disease. Lorenzo breaks into his shop to steal the medicine, and he also takes a wedding dress for Mar\u00eda. Lorenzo goes to prison for stealing, and Mar\u00eda agrees to model for the painter to pay for his release. The artist begins painting a portrait of Mar\u00eda, but when he asks her to pose nude she refuses. The artist finishes the painting with the nude body of another woman. When the people of Xochimilco see the painting, they assume it is Mar\u00eda Candelaria and stone her to death.\n"}
