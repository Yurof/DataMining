{"wikiId": "17816459", "titre": "I've Loved You So Long", "dateSortie": "2008-03-19", "duree": "110.0", "genre": ["Mystery", "Drama", "World cinema"], "resume": "When Juliette Fontaine, formerly a doctor, is released from prison, her younger sister L\u00e9a invites her to stay with her family \u2013 including her husband, his mute father, and their two adopted Vietnamese daughters \u2013 in their home in the university town of Nancy in Lorraine. Why Juliette was in prison is revealed slowly throughout the film: first, that she was in prison for 15 years, then that her crime was murder, then that the victim was her 6-year-old son Pierre, and finally the reason why she killed him. L\u00e9a, a college professor of literature, is considerably younger than Juliette. Because of the nature of Juliette's crime, their parents denied Juliette's existence and refused to allow L\u00e9a to visit her. In addition, Juliette had refused to speak throughout her trial. As a result, L\u00e9a knows nothing about the circumstances surrounding the crime and, when pressed for details, Juliette refuses to discuss what happened until the end of the film. While struggling to find employment, Juliette enjoys platonic companionship with two men, a probation officer who understands how prison can damage the human spirit, and Michel, one of L\u00e9a's colleagues, who is sympathetic to her ordeal of having been imprisoned. Gradually, Juliette begins to fit in with L\u00e9a and her family, makes friends, and finds a permanent job as a secretary at a hospital. She also develops a close relationship with her young nieces, much to the distress of their father, who is concerned about their safety while in their aunt's presence. Slowly, after seeing how she interacts with the family, he begins to accept her. Juliette agrees to accompany L\u00e9a on a visit to their mother, who is confined to a nursing home with Alzheimer's disease. For a brief moment the woman recognizes and embraces her, remembering her as a little girl rather than the estranged daughter who murdered her grandson. L\u00e9a accidentally discovers a clue as to why Juliette killed her son. Juliette diagnosed her son as suffering from a fatal and painful disease. L\u00e9a confronts Juliette with what she learned, and Juliette explains that when her son's condition progressed to where the pain was unbearable, Juliette killed him. During her trial, she felt so guilty for bringing her son into the world, condemned to die, she felt she deserved prison. After a cathartic, emotional scene between the two sisters, Lea looks at a window  and comments on how beautiful it is. Juliette agrees, and the film ends with Juliette saying, \"I am here.\"\n"}
