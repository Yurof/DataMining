Directed by Bardot\u2019s former husband Roger Vadim, the film features a nude dance sequence, which was controversially risqu\u00e9 at the time of the film\u2019s release. Michel Subor was cast as Bardot\u2019s fraught suitor in the role that made him famous. Sophie is not content with the status quo in her relationship with high-flying reporter boyfriend Philippe , but she is even less impressed when wealthy American girl Barbara  threatens to steal him from her. She resolves to win Philippe back or murder her rival, and enlists her doctor friend Alain to aid her in making him jealous. Sophie and Alain travel from Paris to the ski resorts of Italy to chase Philippe and Barbara, treating us to marvelous French comedy in the mischief that ensues.\n"}
