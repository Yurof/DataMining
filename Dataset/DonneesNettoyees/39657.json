He speaks of how, deeply saddened by his younger son's actions, he did the only thing a parent could do in a situation like this \u2014 he prayed, and continued loving. When his son finally came home, he joyfully accepted him back into the family with his complete heart. The only thing that saddens him still is that his older son, though doing all the right things outwardly, is more lost than the younger son ever was, because of his heart-attitude.\n"}
