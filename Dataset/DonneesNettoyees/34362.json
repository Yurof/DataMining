During one such robbery, the car\u2019s owner catches the two in the act. They roll up the windows and lock the doors to prevent intrusion. Helplessly trapped inside the troublesome vehicle by a mob that has now closed in around them, the pair forces a clear path through the crowd by brandishing a gun, before making their escape into the street. However, the stolen car only proves to be the first step in a more elaborate scheme. Spotting an attractive waitress named \u00c1ngela at a local cafeteria, Pablo is immediately captivated by the receptive  young woman, who soon becomes his lover, promising to stay together always. Pablo teaches \u00c1ngela to shoot a gun and, subsequently, inducts her into their gang after an afternoon of makeshift target shooting. The gang now consists of four members: Pablo, Meca, \u00c1ngela, and Sebastian or \"Sebas\". Sebas has joined the group to help in a series of more ambitious thefts, but he is initially unhappy with the presence of a girl in the band. Pablo, with Meca\u2019s support, assures him that \u00c1ngela can hold her own. In the first robbery, that of a factory office on the outskirts of Madrid, \u00c1ngela, disguised as a boy with a mustache, serves as a lookout. In the second holdup, she shoots one of the guards who has fired at the gang\u2019s car. At the conclusion of each of these robberies, Meca brings the getaway car, usually a stolen one, to a deserted area and set it ablaze. He stands by the side of the fire and enjoys viewing the flames. Alternately spending their idle time at discoth\u00e8ques and video arcades, acting on their impulsive whims, and succumbing to the intoxication of drug use, the emboldened quartet begins to stage an ever-escalating series of hold-ups throughout the city. Their share of the money from the two successful robberies enables \u00c1ngela and Pablo to buy a new apartment on the outskirts of the city. It is from this location that the gang plans a third robbery, the assault on a branch bank in one of the more congested middle-class neighborhoods of Madrid. During this robbery, Sebas kills one of the guards and is, in turn, gunned down outside the bank by a squad of police who have surrounded the area. Pablo, Meca, and \u00c1ngela manage to make a getaway, but Pablo has been seriously wounded and is bleeding profusely. \u00c1ngela brings him back to the apartment to nurse him while Meca disposes of the getaway car in the usual manner. However, the black cloud of smoke attracts a police helicopter and Meca is killed as he resists arrest. Understanding the seriousness of Pablo\u2019s wound, \u00c1ngela calls a doctor who, upon arriving at the apartment, confirms the gravity of Pablo\u2019s condition. He has been shot in the liver and must be brought to a hospital if he is to survive. Refusing, she offers him a large bundle of cash if he will treat Pablo right there. Taking the money in his black satchel, the physician promises to return shortly with instruments for surgery. Hours pass, but the doctor does not come back. Pablo, who remains unconscious, lies immobile on the bed. He stops breathing while \u00c1ngela sits in the darkened room staring at him. When she realizes he is dead, she fills her own duffel bag with the remaining money from the robbery and walks of the apartment. She disappears into the shadows of the approaching night walking towards the city.\n"}
