Ms. Baldwin is fighting Spring Fever and daydreams while teaching her class. They take pride in turning out well trained secretaries. They are having problems teaching a secretarial student, named Maizie  who cannot spell, take dictation or type. When the instructors ask her what she is doing at the school, she replies with, \u201cI\u2018m here for the same reason that every other smart girl\u2019s here - to, uh, get a chance to meet nice men.\u201d Ms. Davis tells her, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen to be a matrimonial agency.\u201d Next, a former student drops by with a perspective student and informs the owners that she is getting married to a Junior Vice President . This leads Ms. Baldwin to wonder if these young ladies are onto something. Meanwhile, a client, Mr. Gilbert  who is the editor of Body and Brain magazine continues to fire secretarial graduates from the Supreme Secretarial School. He calls the school and over the phone, Mr. Gilbert complains to Ms. Baldwin about inept secretaries. Ms. Baldwin covers the phone receiver and repeats what he is saying to Ms. Davis. Ms. Baldwin says to Ms. Davis, \u201cHe wants to know what\u2019s wrong with the modern woman?\u201d Ms. Davis replies, \u201c.. the modern man.\u201d Ms. Baldwin decides to go to Mr. Gilbert\u2019s office to see what he expects of a secretary. When they meet, he inadvertently thinks she is a secretary rather than the owner of the school and tells her to report to work in the morning. She is immediately smitten with Mr. Gilbert and decides to work as his secretary.\n"}
