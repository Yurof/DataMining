Tat\u00e3o, however, is a cinephile who largely ignores him, whereas Francisco is also an amateur theatre player; so his amateur theatre company, the Grandellinhas, uses its rehearsals of the play O Pai Tirano  to present Francisco as a son who split from his tyrant father for love, and woo Tat\u00e3o.\n"}
