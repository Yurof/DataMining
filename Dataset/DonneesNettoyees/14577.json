It ostensibly represents Perth as \u2018the greatest city in the world\u2019, while an enthusiastic voice over is contradicted with images of an empty city. It also suggests a fantastical element to the city by referring to \u2018Old Bertie\u2019, a mythical Kracken that lurks in the Swan River.\n"}
