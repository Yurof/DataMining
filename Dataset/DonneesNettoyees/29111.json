A banner hangs off his back. \"Ogami: Suiouryo technique\" , it says. His services are asked for in a most unexpected way, when an insane woman seizes Daigoro from the cart and proceeds to try to breastfeed the boy. Daigoro at first hesitates, but after stern look from his father, he proceeds to suckle the crazy woman's breast. The woman's mother then apologizes for her daughter's behavior and tries to give Itt\u014d money, but the stoic ronin refuses, saying his son was hungry anyway. As he walks in the rain, he remembers another rainy day several months earlier when his wife, Asami, was slain by three ninjas, ostensibly in revenge for Itt\u014d's execution of a boy daimyo, but it was really part of a complicated plot by the shogun's inspector Bizen and the \"Shadow\" Yagy\u016b Clan to frame Itt\u014d for treason and take over the executioner's post. Now a wandering assassin for hire, Itt\u014d takes a job from a Chamberlain, to kill a rival and his gang of henchmen, who pose a threat to the chamberlain's lord. The chamberlain plans to test Itt\u014d, but a quick slash behind his back with his Dotanuki sword dispatches the chamberlain's two men. The targets are in a remote mountain village that is home to hot-spring spa pools. As Itt\u014d pushes the baby cart, and Daigoro observes scenes of nature, such as a mother dog suckling one puppy, and two children singing a song and bouncing a ball, Itt\u014d thinks back again to the time just after his wife was killed. He gave Daigoro a choice between a toy ball or the sword. If the child chose the ball, Itt\u014d would put him to death send him to be with his mother \u2013 a better place in his opinion. But the curious child reaches for the sword \u2013 he has chosen to take the path of the ronin with his father, to live like demons at the crossroads to hell. Eventually, Itt\u014d reaches the hot-spring village. He finds that the rival chamberlain and his men have hired a band of ronins who have taken over the town and are raping, looting and pillaging. Itt\u014d is forced to give up his sword and take his place as a hostage in the village. The ronins discuss killing Itt\u014d, but then decide to let him live if he will have sex with the town's remaining prostitute while they watch. The prostitute refuses to have any part in it, but then she's threatened by one of the men, a knife expert, and in order to save the woman, Itt\u014d steps forward and disrobes, saying he will do the men's bidding with the woman. The episode takes one more trip back to the past, for the dramatic beheading and blood-spurting scene in which Itt\u014d defeats one of Yagy\u016b Retsudo's best swordsman, with the aid of a mirror on Daigoro's forehead to reflect the sun into the swordsman's eyes. And then there is the big showdown in the village, where it is revealed that the baby cart harbors some secrets \u2013 various edged weapons, including a spear-like naginata, which Itt\u014d uses to take out the evil chamberlain's men, chopping one off at his ankles, leaving the bloody stumps of his feet still standing on the ground. One of the men has matchlock pistols, but Itt\u014d quickly upturns the baby cart, which is revealed to be armored underneath, and when the gunman's pistols are empty, Itt\u014d quickly leaps over the baby cart and brings his blade down on the man's forehead, splitting it two. Itt\u014d leaves the village, and the prostitute hopes to follow, but Itt\u014d makes a motion to cut the ropes on the bridge leading to town, to stop her from following, for the journey he is on is one that is for only him and Daigoro to make.\n"}
