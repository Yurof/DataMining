When he finally gets out of bed, King Pfui, Ferdinand Munier, is impressed when they catch \u201cThe Beard\u201d, Francis McDonald, as Disputin, spraying him with seltzer waters, to convince him to give up the location of the other smugglers in the ring. Little do any of them suspect that it is really Leni Stengel, as Queen Olga, with her Ladies in Waiting, who is really behind it all. It looks like it\u2019s going to be off with their heads! But, it turns out to be a bunch of baloney!http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024212/\n"}
