The storyline is interesting but the manner in which the vendetta takes place spoils the film. Inspired from an Hollywood film which focussed on the nexus between the judiciary- police in New York, director Maharasan spins off a tale to suit the local condition and in the process leaves behind lot of holes in the narration. At the very outset the film gives you a taste of things to come. Anandraj a lawyer who argues for rapists and murderers is killed by a cricket ball hit by Arjun. Arjun is a GM of a five star hotel owned by S V Shekar. Shekar\u2019s daughter is Lara Dutta who is introduced with a sexy song. She comes from abroad to join her dad\u2019s hotel but only as a traineee under the macho GM. Within no time Lara is in love with Arjun. It\u2019s now time for duets . Lara\u2019s friend Karan is a campaigner of public cause. His efforts lead to a brothel raid and a minister getting arrested. The minister\u2019s goons bump off Karan and Arjun is an eyewitness.
