A strong bond exists between the two men, transcending their racial differences. \"No woman will come between us,\" Naldinho tells Deco, and Deco concurs: \"All the women in the world couldn't come between us.\" That bond is tested after the men meet Karina, a dancer and prostitute. Karina needs a ride, and she offers the two men her \"services\" in exchange for transport on their boat and a little cash. The emotional entanglements that result from Karina's \"deal\" are stronger than the trio expected. Deco and Naldinho develop a desire to possess Karina. Karina's desires are more subtle, though its clear that she feels both a sisterly affection and sexual attraction toward the two men.\n"}
