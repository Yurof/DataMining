The train passes through the lush and dense vegetation of the thick forests and stops by farm estates along the route like Lukula, the Urselia domain , Lubuzi River and its new bridge, the Kangu mission and Tshela, where manufactured products are loaded onto boats for shipment to Europe. The train journey is also an eyewitness account of the workings of a well-oiled colonial system and the development of the black workforce at its service.\n"}
