The film shifts back and forth to follow the point of view of each of the women as they are stalked and haunted by the blood hunger psychopath. Each sequence shows the women engage in graphic drug use and sex, that both come off very real to the naked eye, and reveals a little bit more of the story before each woman is ultimately \u201cjudged\u201d by Michael.Plot Synopsis by Jason Buchanan AllRovi.comAmazon.com movie page\n"}
