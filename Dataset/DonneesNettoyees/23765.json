Godbout is not well-considered by Quebec historians and citizens. Ad\u00e9rald Godbout was the Second World War&ndash;era Quebec head of government, and the great-uncle of the director. Godbout advances some theories to explain why his great-uncle was forgotten in the collective memory of the Quebecers. One theory is that Ad\u00e9lard Godbout was more favourable than other political leaders to conscription. Quebec nationalists, at the time, opposed conscription, which they saw as a British imperialist manoeuvre of English Canada to defend the Empire.\n"}
