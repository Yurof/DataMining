For instance, a marabout explains that he no longer replies by letter to questions from Africans living abroad: he uses his cell phone. Another eloquent illustration of the digital revolution in Africa is the proliferation of Internet caf\u00e9s full of young people. It raises challenging questions about the use of technology in various domains, and in documenting humanity's memory and also asks how digital technology might be used in the service of African people tomorrow.\n"}
