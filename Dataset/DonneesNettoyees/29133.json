Gordon Liddy, former assistant to United States President Richard Nixon. The original line is from Nietzsche's Twilight of the Idols, \"From life's school of war: what does not kill me makes me stronger.\" \"A burst of drums and trumpets\" accompanies the forging of a sword, after which the scene shifts to a mountain top, where the swordsmith tells his young son Conan about the Riddle of Steel, an aphorism on the importance of the metal to their people, the Cimmerians. They meet Valeria, a female brigand. The three burgle the \"Tower of Serpents\", a temple of Doom's snake cult, and steal a large jewel&mdash;the Eye of the Serpent&mdash;and other valuables; Conan and Subotai also battle and slay a large snake. After escaping with their loot, the thieves celebrate and end up in a drunken stupor. The city guards capture them and bring them to King Osric. He requests they rescue his daughter, who has joined Doom's cult. Subotai and Valeria do not want to take up the quest; Conan, motivated by his hatred for Doom, sets off alone to the villain's Temple of Set. and warns that they will \"extract a heavy toll\", which Valeria is willing to pay. These spirits also try to abduct Conan, but he is restored to health after Valeria and Subotai fend them off. Conan sneaks back into the temple where Doom stands at the top of a long stairway, addressing the members of his cult. Conan confronts Doom, who attempts to mesmerize him, but the barbarian resists and uses his father's sword to behead his nemesis. After throwing Doom's head down the stairs, Conan burns down the temple.\n"}
