Fran\u00e7ois then locks himself in his room in a guest house at the top of many flights of stairs. He is soon besieged by the police, who fail in an attempt to shoot themselves into the room, as Fran\u00e7ois barricades himself in. In a series of flashbacks punctuated by glimpses of the present, it is revealed that Fran\u00e7ois had become involved with both the naive young floral shop worker Fran\u00e7oise , and the more experienced Clara , who until she met Fran\u00e7ois had been the assistant in Valentin's performing dog act. It becomes clear that the manipulative Valentin, an older man, had himself been involved with both women, and he becomes jealous of Fran\u00e7ois . Finally Valentin confronts Fran\u00e7ois in his room, bringing with him the gun with which Fran\u00e7ois eventually shoots him. As we return to the present, Fran\u00e7ois continues to chain-smoke nervously in his room. Fran\u00e7oise, having learned of his plight, has become delirious and is being tended to by Clara in her room at a nearby hotel. Then, two policemen climb over the roof of Fran\u00e7ois's building, preparing to throw tear gas grenades through the window of Fran\u00e7ois's room. Before they can do so, Fran\u00e7ois, consumed with despair, shoots himself in the heart. The film ends with tear gas clouds filling the room around his lifeless body.\n"}
