When he is not taxiing his usual fares, Reggie can be found enjoying a game of bowling in the morning league, breaking for a cup of coffee with his cab-cleaning pal Mugford , arguing with his ex-wife Nola O\u2019Brien , filling in his co-worker and former Pentecostal minister Pastor Bob  on the ways of secular world, hanging with his buddy Bounty \u201cThe Dog\u201d Hunter , arguing with cab company owner Raoul Cassivi , or clashing with the authority of Kingston\u2019s taxi commissioner, Bruno DeLuca . When a film crew spends a day with Reggie, documenting a day in the life of a cab driver, his world seems to fall apart. When he gets word that Pat James , the owner of his favourite radio station and Kingston\u2019s only country music station, is going to flip to an \u201call women, all talk\u201d format, Reggie pulls no stops to keep country music on Kingston\u2019s airwaves. And just when he thinks he has a stake in the grand prize of the \u201cDrink to the Bottom and Win\u201d contest at the local coffee shop, he learns the true meaning of friendship. To keep his cab on the road, and his dream alive, Reggie has to overcome adversity, friendship, and himself.\n"}
