During the long sea voyage, Capt. Christopher Jones  falls in love with Dorothy Bradford , the wife of William Bradford . The love triangle is resolved in a tragic way at the film's conclusion. Ship's carpenter John Alden  -- said to be the first person to step foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620 -- catches the eye of Priscilla Mullins , one of the young Pilgrims following William Bradford. Alden ultimately wins Priscilla in another, if subtler, triangle with Miles Standish . Lloyd Bridges provides comic relief as the first-mate Coppin, and child star Tommy Ivo gives a touching performance as young William Button, the only passenger to die on the actual voyage across the storm-swept Atlantic, who, according to this film, wanted to be the first to sight land and to become a king in the New World. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the first to see land. Keep me eye peeled, I will. Then I\u2019ll be the first. It\u2019ll be like the Garden of Eden and I\u2019m going to be the first to see it\u201d.\n"}
