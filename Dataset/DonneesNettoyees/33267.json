It revolves around two peasant couples \u2013 Genjur\u014d and Miyagi, T\u014dbei and Ohama \u2013 who are uprooted as Shibata Katsuie's army sweeps through their farming village, Nakanog\u014d. Genjur\u014d, a potter, takes his wares to nearby \u014cmizo. He is accompanied by T\u014dbei, who dreams of becoming a samurai. A respected sage tells Miyagi to warn her husband about seeking profit in time of upheaval, and to prepare for a probable attack on the village. Genjur\u014d arrives with his profits, but she asks him to stop. Genjur\u014d nevertheless works long hours to finish his pottery. That night Nakanog\u014d is attacked by soldiers, and the four main characters hide out in the woods. Genjur\u014d decides to take the pots to a different marketplace, and the two couples travel across a lake. Out of the thick fog another boat appears. The sole passenger tells them he was attacked by pirates, warns them back to their homes, then dies. The two men decide to return their wives to the shore. T\u014dbei's wife refuses to go; Miyagi begs Genjur\u014d not to leave her, but is left on the shore with their young son clasped to her back. At market, Genjur\u014d's pottery sells well. After taking his promised share of the profits, T\u014dbei runs off to buy samurai armor, and sneaks into the ranks of a clan of samurai. Lost from her companions, Ohama has wandered beyond Nagahama in her desperate search for T\u014dbei. She is raped by a group of soldiers. Genjur\u014d is visited by a noblewoman and her female servant, who order several pieces of pottery and tell him to take them to the Kutsuki mansion. Genjur\u014d learns that soldiers have attacked the manor and killed all who lived there, except Lady Wakasa and her three servants. He also learns that Lady Wakasa's father haunts the manor. Genjur\u014d is seduced by Lady Wakasa, and she convinces him to marry her. Meanwhile, Nakanog\u014d is under attack. Miyagi and her son hide from soldiers and are found by an elderly woman who hurries them to safety. In the woods, several soldiers desperately search her for food. She fights with the soldiers and is stabbed. She collapses with her son still clutching her back. T\u014dbei steals the severed head of a general, which he presents to the commander of the victorious side. He is rewarded with armor, a mount, and a retinue. T\u014dbei later rides into the marketplace on his new horse, eager to return home to show his wife. However, he visits a brothel and finds her working there. T\u014dbei promises to buy back her honor. Later, the two return to Nakanog\u014d, T\u014dbei sans armor. Genjur\u014d meets a priest, who tells him to return to his loved ones or certain death awaits him. When Genjur\u014d mentions the noblewoman, the priest reveals that the noblewoman is dead and must be exorcised, and then invites Genjur\u014d to his home where he paints Buddhist prayers on his body. Genjur\u014d returns to the Kutsuki mansion. He admits that he is married, has a child and wishes to return home. Lady Wakasa will not let him go. They admit they are spirits, returned to this world so that Lady Wakasa, who was slain before she knew love, could experience its joys. She tells him to wash away the Buddhist symbols. Genjur\u014d reaches for a sword, throws himself out of the manor, and passes out. The next day, he is awakened by soldiers. They accuse him of stealing the sword, but he denies it, saying it is from the Kutsuki mansion. The soldiers laugh at him, saying the Kutsuki mansion was burned down over a month ago. Genjur\u014d arises and finds the mansion he has lived in is nothing more than a pile of burnt wood. Miyagi, delighted to see him, will not let him tell of his terrible mistake. Genjur\u014d holds his sleeping son in his arms, and eventually lies down to sleep. The next morning, Genjur\u014d wakes to the village chief knocking on his door. He is surprised to see Genjur\u014d home, and expresses concern. He explains that he has been caring for Genjur\u014d's son, and that the boy must have come to his old home in the middle of the night. Genjur\u014d calls for Miyagi. The neighbor asks if Genjur\u014d is dreaming, as his wife is dead. Miyagi's spirit tells Genjur\u014d: \"I am always with you\".\n"}
