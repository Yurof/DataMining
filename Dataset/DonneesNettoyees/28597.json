{"wikiId": "2417736", "titre": "The Sorrow and the Pity", "dateSortie": "1971", "duree": "265.0", "genre": ["History", "War film", "Documentary"], "resume": "Part One of the film, The Collapse, has an extended interview with Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France. He was jailed by the Vichy government on charges of desertion, but escaped from jail to join Charles de Gaulle's forces operating out of England, and later served as Prime Minister of liberated France. Part Two, The Choice, revolves around Christian de la Mazi\u00e8re, who is something of a counterpoint to Mend\u00e8s-France. Whereas Mend\u00e8s-France was a French Jewish political figure who joined the Resistance, de la Mazi\u00e8re, an aristocrat who embraced Fascism, was one of 7,000 French youth to fight on the Eastern Front wearing German uniforms. The film shows the French people's response to occupation as heroic, pitiable, and monstrous, sometimes all at once. The postwar humiliation of the women who served  Vichy men perhaps gives the strongest mix of all three. Maurice Chevalier's \"Sweepin' the Clouds Away\" is the theme tune of the film.\n"}
