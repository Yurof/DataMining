Convinced he can make Owens into Marine material, Moore pushes Owens to the point of desertion. Barrett's screenplay expanded the play by introducing subplots of Moore having a romance with a local shop girl  and having Owens' mother  make a trip to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot to beg the Corps to keep her son in to make a man out of him.\n"}
