The story reworks themes from Japanese folklore, focusing on the relationship between Sakata no Kintoki  and Minamoto no Raik\u014d, one of the first military Minamoto and \"monster hunters\" of folklore.Sansom, George .

The story replaces the traditional image of Kintaro - a strong, ruddy-cheeked man\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u65b0\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 (Kenkyusha Japanese-English Dictionary, \"Kintar\u014d\" - with that of a determined, tomboyish girl, while retaining much of the traditional character such as the carrying of an axe.http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Animation/kaidohmaru/introduction/character/kintoki.html Other historical figures from the period who have also become objects of folklore, such as Fujiwara no Michinaga and the rebel Taira no Masakado also make an appearance. The story begins at Mount Ashigara in Sagami Province in the Sh\u014dryakuera, where the young Kintoki is caught in a bloody family feud. Disguised as a boy by her father to protect her from her uncle's ambitions to take over the family, Kintoki's memories of her childhood indicate that she was intended as the next head of the family. She is almost killed by her uncle when he kills her family in a coup, but is rescued by the arrival of the warrior Minamoto no Raik\u014d, who takes her back to the capital. There she grows up and joins Raik\u014d's band of warriors, known as the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" Shitenn\u014d, and grows very close to Raik\u014d, though their apparent feelings for each other remain undeclared. Five years later  she joins Raik\u014d and his associates in policing the capital during a period of unrest caused by an outbreak of disease and bandits from Oeyama. Unbeknownst to Kintoki, the bandit leader Shuten D\u014dji is in fact his cousin, Ohni-hime. Ohni-hime is unaware that Kintoki is not a man, and has come to Heian-ky\u014d to \"rescue\" him. The Oeyama bandits are secretly acting in cooperation Fujiwara no Michinaga, who hopes to use the chaos they cause to extend his control over the government. This results in the burning of the capital by Shuten D\u014dji and her follower Taira no Masakado. In the fighting, several of Raik\u014d's associates are killed and Kintoki is abducted by Ohni-hime, forcing Raik\u014d to seek her out in the bandit's Oeyama lair.http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Animation/kaidohmaru/introduction/story/index.html\n"}
