During the fight a member of the gang, Mick Bourke, is accidentally shot by one of the bushrangers and he begs Hall to put him out of his misery. The Keightleys run out of ammunition and surrender, and Hall and his men spend the night at the homestead. Hall offers to spare Mr Keightley's life if he can raise \u00a3500 and gives his wife eight hours to ride thirty miles to Bathurst to collect the money from her father at the bank. She manages to accomplish this just in time, and Hall leaves the homestead with the Keightleys alive.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900\u20131977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 17.\n"}
