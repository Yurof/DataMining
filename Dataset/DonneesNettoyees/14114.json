After three months, all passion has disappeared, and after an argument, Herv\u00e9 leaves the house for a drink at a club. There, he is seduced by Anita Flor\u00e8s , a red-headed dance instructor. Unbeknownst to him, Anita is a scam artist who has sent her boyfriend L\u00e9on  to photograph her in companionship with Herv\u00e9. Although Herv\u00e9 eventually decides to stay faithful to his wife, L\u00e9on is able to take some pictures of their intimate moments. Herv\u00e9 refuses to give in to any of her attempts to blackmail him, until she calls him one night. Virginie and Albert overhear the conversation, after which Virginie concludes that her husband is having an affair. The next day, she follows him to Anita's dance studio, and when looking through the key hole, she spots Anita's murdered body next to Herv\u00e9, who is holding a gun. Herv\u00e9 convinces her that he is not guilty and they flee the place of crime through the back door, although they are noticed by some of the staff members. To prove her husband's innocence, she charms Anita's husband Flor\u00e8s  into hiring her as a dance teacher in order to able herself of finding more information. While going through the studio, Virginie catches L\u00e9on stealing money from her wallet and overhears a conversation between L\u00e9on and his mistress Daisy , who plan on misleading the detectives. After several investigations of the inspectors, Virginie is convinced that she has found the murderer through a letter. According to her, this man is G\u00e9rard Lalemand. Because the detectives do not believe her, she decides to contact G\u00e9rard herself. She talks to him over the phone and arranges a meeting, but when he fails to show up, she locates his residence, where she is told that Mr. Lalemand has been dead for over three years. Virginie realizes that she has been talking to G\u00e9rard's son , who is the same charming gay man whom she met earlier at the studio. Meanwhile, L\u00e9on has been arrested for blackmailing Herv\u00e9. He admits that he is the mysterious person who left the studio over the roof on the night of the murder, but claims that Herv\u00e9 is the guilty one. To Herv\u00e9's surprise, Albert proves his innocence to the detectives. In the meantime, Virginie believes that she has tracked Lalemand down to Blue Fetish, a gay nightclub where he is performing as a transvestite under the alias Daniel. Upon confronting him, she realizes that the man  is not Lalemand, and she leaves soon afterwards to return to his residence. There, she finds out that the real Lalemand is an acquaintance to Flor\u00e8s and Daisy, who have given a false statement when Lalemand was still a suspect. Virginie is told that Anita was Lelemand's father's mistress and that she had permission to profit from Lelemand's $50 million inheritance while she was still alive. Therefore, Lelemand has sent his boyfriend Daniel to kill Anita. Herv\u00e9's innocence is proven, and he gratefully kisses his wife.\n"}
