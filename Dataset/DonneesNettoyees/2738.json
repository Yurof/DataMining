When Bala is not zooming around in jeeps with a wild-looking gang, parading down lanes with the same gang faithfully following a step behind him, or knocking down one person or another, he's successfully wooing Arthi, the girl he has fallen for at first sight. Arthi is the daughter of Jeyamani, a rival gangster. Ailing don Paranthaman , mentor of the two rivals, seeing his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at each other's throats, brings a compromise by suggesting that Arthi be married to Pasupathi's wayward son. Bala naturally becomes a pariah in both camps, till it's all's well that ends well.\n"}
