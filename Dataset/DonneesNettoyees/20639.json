Indeed, much like Stepan Trofimovich, Jeanson is an intellectual and philosopher who serves as a kind of father-figure/mentor to V\u00e9ronique \u2014 and his early example as a supporter of terrorism makes him responsible for influencing much of the destruction which is to follow. Eventually, the train arrives at its destination and V\u00e9ronique sets off to the hotel where the Soviet Minister of Culture is staying. She mistakenly reverses the digits of the room number and ends up killing the wrong man. As in The Possessed, the revolutionary activities of the Aden Arabie cell have proved unsuccessful.\n"}
