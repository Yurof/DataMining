{"wikiId": "214324", "titre": "The Shop on Main Street", "dateSortie": "1965", "duree": "125.0", "genre": ["War film", "Drama", "World cinema", "Czechoslovak New Wave"], "resume": "During World War II, a mild-mannered Slovak carpenter Anton \"T\u00f3no\" Brtko  is offered the chance to take over the sewing notions store of an old, near-deaf Jewish woman Roz\u00e1lia Lautmannov\u00e1  as a part of the enactment of an Aryanization regulation in the town. As T\u00f3no attempts to explain to Mrs. Lautmannov\u00e1, who is oblivious of the world outside and generally confused, that he has come to be her supervisor and owner of the store, Imrich Kuch\u00e1r , a Slovak opponent of Aryanization, steps in and reveals to Brtko that the business itself is less than profitable, as Lautmannov\u00e1 herself relies on donations. The Jewish community then offers the amiable Brtko a weekly payment if he does not give up the store, which would otherwise be given to a new, possibly ruthless Aryanizer. T\u00f3no accepts and lets Mrs. Lautmannov\u00e1 believe he is her nephew who has come to help in the store. Their relationship grows, until the authorities round up the town's entire Jewish population for transport, and T\u00f3no finds himself conflicted as to whether he should turn in the senile Mrs. Lautmannov\u00e1, or hide her. When the woman finally becomes aware of the \"pogrom\" all around her, she panics, and in attempting to silence her, T\u00f3no accidentally kills her. The realization devastates him, and he hangs himself.\n"}
