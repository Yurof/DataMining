The Italian, who is beautiful and a free spirit, is originally from the countryside. During her search she meets anthropology professor Micha\u0142 , who is renting her an apartment that was occupied by his brother. The business is concluded by a violent sex scene between the two in the empty apartment. Micha\u0142 is engaged with Anna , an architect and daughter of his director. During excavations with his students and his younger colleague Juliuz  he finds the well-conserved body of a shaman more than two thousand years old. In the laboratory they try to determine the cause of the shaman's death, which does not seem to be natural. The life of Micha\u0142 is turned upside down by the discovery of the shaman's body and his increasingly obsessive love affair with the Italian. For the Italian, he breaks with his fianc\u00e9e Anna and his friends. He tries to tame the Italian, but she resists his domination, always unforeseeable and rebellious. In the laboratory, during one moment of illumination, Micha\u0142 comes into contact with the spirit of the shaman. He reveals to him that he was killed by a woman who wanted to capture his magic power. Micha\u0142, who finally regards himself as free and lucid breaks up with the Italian. She does not accept his decision, and bludgeons Micha\u0142 to death and eats his brain.\n"}
