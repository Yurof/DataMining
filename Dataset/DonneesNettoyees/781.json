{"wikiId": "33679627", "titre": "Darwin", "dateSortie": "2011-02-02", "duree": "88.0", "genre": ["Historical fiction", "Drama", "Documentary"], "resume": "Darwin is a documentary film about an isolated community at the end of a weathered road in Death Valley, California. Propelled from society by tragic turns, the people of Darwin  must now find ways to coexist in a place without a government, a church, jobs, or children. The near-ghost town's survival depends on a fragile, gravity-fed waterline that descends from the mountains where top secret weapons are being tested. One \"accidental\" drop of a bomb, they half-joke, could wipe out their entire town. The film tells the story of a uniquely American place and yet a place that is unique even within America.\n"}
