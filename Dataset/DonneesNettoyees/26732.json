As most of the inhabitants are illiterate, they have no choice but to ask for the help of Ant\u00f4nio Bi\u00e1, a man who has been ostracized ever since it was discovered that he had sent out letters with lies about their reputations as a way to keep his job in Jav\u00e9's seldom-used post office. He now has the task of documenting people's memories of how the city was founded, yet each inhabitant has his or her own version of what happened.\n"}
