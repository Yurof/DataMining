{"wikiId": "9213960", "titre": "Manda Bala", "dateSortie": "2007", "duree": "85.0", "genre": ["Culture & Society", "Biography", "Indie", "World cinema", "Law & Crime", "Documentary"], "resume": "Manda Bala profiles such subjects as a businessman who bullet-proofs his cars, a plastic surgeon who reconstructs the ears of kidnap victims, former Governor and Senator J\u00e1der Barbalho, a powerful Brazilian politician from the state of Par\u00e1 who used a frog farm for money laundering, and the owner of the frog farm himself . The film details many of the reasons for Brazil's corruption including the fact that politicians in office there are exempt from civilian court proceedings, with the consequence that they will never be punished for crimes they commit in office. Another factor \u2014 and the other driving point of the film \u2014 is the ubiquity of kidnapping in Brazil, which ensures that the likelihood of redressing these crimes is fairly low and that someone's enemies  are apt to disappear fairly easily.  ; Frog Farmer: a frog farmer who genuinely enjoys his trade. His wife asked him to make a choice, keep her or keep the frogs. The frog farmer chose the frogs. The frog farms were used by Jader Barbalho to illegally launder money. ; Businessman: after telling a story about how he was robbed while sitting in traffic, he discusses how unsafe he feels driving in S\u00e3o Paulo and decided to start bulletproofing cars because being without a bulletproof car \"would be crazy\". ; Head of Kidnapping Unit: talks about how commonplace kidnappings are and how difficult they are to resolve successfully and his belief that the government should be involved in solving and preventing kidnappings. Also shows off some of his bullet scars from his dangerous line of work. ; Victim: a victim of a kidnapping who had her ears cut off goes into detail about how her captors made her sleep in cramped quarters with only a bucket to use the bathroom, a TV blaring Hitchcock films, and how they sent pieces of her ear to her family. ; Federal Police Marshal: discusses the details of his investigation into the frog farm's money laundering and corruption and how the initial evidence was gathered against Jader Barbahlo. ; Kidnapper: Discusses how a kidnapping is planned and what happens when a person cannot pay their ransom and also about how he and his organization take care of the poor when they need it, paving streets, giving out food, and other various projects. He then compares himself to a politician that gives to the poor instead of the ones that are in place that have forgotten the poor. Not shown in the film, the kidnapper was later shot by the police in late 2006. ; Jader Barbalho: Discusses the Amazon region , why SUDAM failed, and when the subject of the Frog Farm comes up, he responds that \"I would need more time to talk to you about that, but this is....this is no\" and promptly ends the interview.\n"}
