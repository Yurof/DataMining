{"wikiId": "21447744", "titre": "Bloody Spear at Mount Fuji", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "94.0", "genre": ["Japanese Movies", "Black-and-white"], "resume": "The samurai Sakawa Koj\u016br\u014d is on the road to Edo with his two servants Genta and Genpachi. Koj\u016br\u014d is a kindly master, but his character totally changes when he consumes alcohol. On the road, they encounter many different people: a traveling singer with her child, a father taking his daughter Otane to be sold into prostitution, a pilgrim, a policeman searching for a notorious thief, and T\u014dzabur\u014d, the suspicious man the officer has his eyes on. Genpachi, the spear carrier, is also followed by an orphaned boy named Jir\u014d who wants to be a samurai. When Koj\u016br\u014d and Genpachi inadvertently capture the thief\u2014who was the pilgrim in disguise\u2014Koj\u016br\u014d is disgusted when the authorities praise him and not his servant, even though Genpachi probably contributed more. He is also upset that he does not have the money to save Otane from being sold. In the end it is T\u014dzabur\u014d who saves Otane, using the money he saved to rescue his own daughter, but decided to use for Otane after finding out his daughter had died. Depressed, Koj\u016br\u014d takes Genta out drinking, despite the protests of the latter. When a band of boisterous samurai complain of Koj\u016br\u014d drinking with someone of lower birth, Koj\u016br\u014d gets upset. The samurai pull their swords and kill both the servant and his master. Genpachi arrives too late, but in a fury kills all the samurai with the spear. Authorities do not charge him with a crime, so he heads home carrying the ashes of Koj\u016br\u014d and Genta. When Jir\u014d tries to follow him, he shoos him off, telling him never to become a samurai.\n"}
