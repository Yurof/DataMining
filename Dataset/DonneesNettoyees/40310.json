{"wikiId": "23080180", "titre": "Saat Paake Bandha", "dateSortie": "2009-05-29", "duree": "160.0", "genre": ["Romance Film", "Action", "Drama"], "resume": "Rahul (Jeet , the son of a wealthy but traditional industrialist, returned home to his father after completing his academic career in foreign lands. When the father tries to persuade him in his marriage he puts up a fantastic condition - that he will marry the girl of his father\u2019s choice and will live as married couple for one year only, after which, if either of the two seems to feel distant from the other, the marriage will be called off. Surprisingly, the traditional father agrees and chooses Pallavi , his PA as the most appropriate bride. Now Pallavi\u2019s family consisted of her widowed mother, an elder sister deprived of her husband, a younger brother not at all competent for any job, and the youngest sister getting pregnant with the boyfriend trying to avoid responsibilities. So Pallavi, just to save her family, accepted the contract much against her wishes and thus began a curious way of life with both of the wedlocked couple leading an unreal lifestyle. Though both shared the same bed, but Rahul seemed to be oddly insensitive to Pallavi\u2019s emotions. Thus it was not strange that he never cared to celebrate Pallavi\u2019s birthday and his scathing remarks while appreciating Pallavi\u2019s cooking hurt her feelings and duty seemed the only virtue that kept Rahul any closer to his wife. But the artificiality of the story is vividly brought to fore when Rahul, after quickly recovering from a comatose condition, chiefly due to Pallavi\u2019s sincerest nursing, doesn\u2019t hesitate to declare that the next day is the end of their contract term when he will be willingly divorcing Pallavi. Well at this point if the audience thought that the story is nearing a tragic completion, it is only the Intermission that is declared. In the second half we see that the table turns as Rahul suddenly feels sympathetic to Pallavi and all his passions overwhelms him so much that he rushes to his in-laws\u2019 house and requests Pallavi\u2019s return. But no says the director, and the story goes on with Pallavi now rejecting all the ardent proposals of Rahul, be it him buying all the shares of Pallavi\u2019s new struggling organization just to secure for himself the position of Pallavi\u2019s boss. Surprises seem to be on store for the audience with Pallavi conceiving a child  and now Rahul, in sympathy arranges for an AC bus for her and shifts her office to the ground floor. Now the only thing that remains is revelation and Pallavi invites and insults Rahul in one of the most improbable of settings with Rahul sophisticatedly defending his views. Finally after all these, the two again reunites in hospital bed after the severely injured Rahul takes Pallavi to the maternity ward  and they celebrate the simultaneous delivery of the child and Rahul\u2019s recovery from his critical condition. Thus family ties are again restored and the happy ending is guaranteed.\n"}
