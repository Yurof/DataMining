Set against the beautiful backdrop of the Atlantic Ocean on one side and Signal Hill on the other, the Sea Point Promenade \u2013 and the public swimming pools in its centre \u2013 forms a space unlike any in Cape Town. Once a bastion of Apartheid exclusivity, it is nowadays unique in its apparently easy mix of age, race, gender, religion, wealth status and sexual orientation. Somehow this space has become one where all South Africans feel they have a right to exist, and where the possibility of happiness in a divided world doesn't seem unfeasible. But what is the reality of those coming here? How do people see their past, their present in this space and their future in this country?\n"}
