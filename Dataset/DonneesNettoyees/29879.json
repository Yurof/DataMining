The film flashes back to 1964, when Ren\u00e9e Richards is an eye surgeon named Richard Radley . Radley has a successful career and a fianc\u00e9e, but secretly cross-dresses at night. Unable to speak with his mother Sadie , who is a psychiatrist, Radley consults his own psychiatrist, Dr. Beck , who advises him to grow a beard. This strategy works temporarily until Radley is drafted into the Navy, which does not allow beards. Following his discharge and a failed marriage, Radley undergoes gender reassignment surgery and becomes Ren\u00e9e. Ren\u00e9e relocates to California, resumes her career as a surgeon and begins dating. After playing in a local tennis tournament in La Jolla, Ren\u00e9e is outed as transgender by a television reporter. In the ensuing controversy, Ren\u00e9e takes the United States Tennis Association to court, where she secures her right to play professional tournament tennis as a woman without being subjected to chromosome testing.\n"}
