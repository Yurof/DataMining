Most people consider him stupid, and call him an idiot. The movie begins with Sven and a woman, who we later learn is called Anna, driving an old car across the landscape. The sun is setting, and in the sky Sven sees three angels. He and Anna hide in an old house, and while Anna makes herself comfortable, Sven throws a huge, bloodstained blade into a well. He lies down beside Anna and starts his inner monologue about how it all began. When Sven's mother died, he was \"taken care of\" by H\u00f6glund , an evil factory owner who is a member of the local Nazi party, and lives on a farm. Sven must work on H\u00f6glund's farm without pay, and sleep among cows in the stables, where he is tormented by a rat. Being very goodhearted, Sven cannot make himself drown the animal once he has caught it, because he simply can't take another life.\n"}
