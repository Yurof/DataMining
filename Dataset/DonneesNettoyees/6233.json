{"wikiId": "9215002", "titre": "Bolivia", "dateSortie": "2001", "duree": "76.0", "genre": ["Drama", "World cinema", "Black-and-white", "Indie"], "resume": "The mostly plot-free film is confined to a caf\u00e9-bar in the lower-middle class Buenos Aires neighborhood of Villa Crespo, with few trips outside. Bolivia tells the story of Freddy , a Bolivian with a gentle disposition, who, after Americans burn down the coca fields where he is employed, loses his job. With little work opportunities in Bolivia, he leaves his wife and three daughters and travels to Argentina to search for employment as an undocumented worker. He hopes to make money and later return to his family. He lands a job as a grill cook in a seedy Villa Crespo caf\u00e9 where the brutish owner  is happy to skirt Argentinian immigrant laws in order to secure cheap labor. It is in this caf\u00e9 that Freddy meets the characters who affect his life: Rosa , a waitress of Paraguayan/Argentine descent, and an outsider by virtue of her mixed heritage; H\u00e9ctor , a traveling salesman from the province of C\u00f3rdoba who's gay; a Porte\u00f1o taxi driver , and one of the driver's buddies. Freddy also has to deal with various Argentine caf\u00e9 patrons who view all Paraguayans and Bolivians with disdain due to their ethnicity.\n"}
