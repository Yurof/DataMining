Rather than killing them individually, the crime syndicate brings together 100 people who have in some way wronged the syndicate, provides them with weapons, and gives them a choice: fight or die. The assassins are given six hours to eliminate the competition, and told that the last three will walk away with 10 million dollars. Various agreements and alliances are made as the killers battle for survival and the money.\n"}
