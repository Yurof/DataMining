{"wikiId": "3320756", "titre": "G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom", "dateSortie": "2004", "duree": "77.0", "genre": ["Action/Adventure", "Children's", "Animation"], "resume": "The second movie in the Reel FX series has Cobra kidnapping the G.I. Joe commander General Hawk for nefarious purposes. Doctor Mindbender has invented a method to transform humans, into feral man-beasts that heed Cobra\u2019s bidding. Mindbender calls the process \"Venomization\", wherein human DNA is fused with animal DNA. Cobra Commander\u2019s plan is to brainwash and mutate Hawk into becoming the Venomized troops\u2019 leader. Additionally, the Joe Team is in possession of a magnetic cannon, capable of delivering a cargo almost anywhere in the world, which is exactly the tool Cobra requires to Venomize the human population. As in G.I. Joe: Spy Troops, elements from the comic series published by Devil\u2019s Due are integrated into the story, such as the wrist-com gauntlets, and the not-quite-secret status of the G.I. Joe elite. Previous animated forays likewise portrayed the Joes as publicly recognized heroes. The Cobra V-Troops are introduced, but are never referred to as such, instead merely identified as \"Venomized troops\". From events occurring in this movie, most fans are led to believe that Valor vs. Venom is the precursor to G.I. Joe: Sigma 6. The most notable connection, is the mention of General Hawk being hospitalized for the series, because of having his genes scrambled by Cobra's experiments.\n"}
