Among them is Fran\u00e7ois Laurin, a man of jealous and violent temperament, who is married to \u00c9dith, the daughter of an upright veteran soldier Maria Lazare. Fran\u00e7ois suspects, correctly, that \u00c9dith is conducting an affair with the poet Jean Diaz who lives in the village with his mother, and he sends \u00c9dith to stay with his parents in Lorraine - where she is subsequently captured and raped by German soldiers. Fran\u00e7ois and Jean find themselves serving in the same battalion at the front, where the initial tensions between them give way to a close friendship which acknowledges that they both love \u00c9dith. In 1918 Jean is discharged through ill-health and returns to the village, to find his mother dying. \u00c9dith reappears from captivity, now with a young half-German daughter Ang\u00e8le. Her father, Maria Lazare, immediately leaves to avenge the shame to the family name. When Fran\u00e7ois comes home on leave, Jean and \u00c9dith fear his reaction to the illegitimate child and try to conceal her from him, which merely revives his jealous suspicions of Jean, and the two men fight. When the truth is revealed, Fran\u00e7ois and Jean agree to seek their vengeance in battle and both return to the front. In a great battle, in which a mythical figure of Le Gaulois leads on the French forces, Fran\u00e7ois is wounded and dies in the field hospital. Jean, meanwhile, is so shell-shocked that he becomes insane. He returns to the village and gathers the inhabitants together to tell them of his vision on the battlefield: from the graves of the dead, soldiers arise and gather in a great cohort that marches through the land, back to their homes. Jean challenges the villagers to say whether they have been worthy of the men's sacrifices, and they watch in horror as their dead family and friends appear on the threshold. The soldiers return to their rest, and Jean goes back to his mother's house. There he finds a book of his own poems which he tears up in disgust, until one of them, his Ode to the Sun, drives him to denounce the sun for its complicity in the crimes of war. As the sunlight fades from the room, Jean dies.\n"}
