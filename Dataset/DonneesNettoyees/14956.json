The only escape for his creative instincts, besides nightly conversations with a poster of Robert De niro\u2019s Raging Bull, is occasional bottom-of-the-line stage melodramas. Ali makes money as a butchers\u2019 accountant in his neighborhood\u2019s souq, where his father is a vegetable vendor. This quarter, Rod al-Faraj, is emblematic of a number of inner-city neighborhoods in Cairo, which have been erased, and isolated their residents to desert suburbs by an Egyptian government, wanting to restore its historic monuments and attract tourists. Throughout the film, there\u2019s a point at which Ali\u2019s souq, slotted for tourist gentrification, is shut by the Egyptian internal security. He finally decides to escape Egypt and pursue acting in France. Two years later we do find him acting, not on stage but in the boxing ring. Unable to find legal work, he has fallen in with a fellow countryman who pays him to \u201cthrow\u201d fights in crooked boxing matches. Ali is again stripped of his livelihood. After his business is forcibly absorbed by French gangsters, Ali\u2019s partner betrays him and flees to Egypt, leaving him penniless and without an identity. Ultimately the actor finds himself back in Rod al-Faraj, having to start his life quite literally from scratchhttp://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/al-madina-two-movies-one-egyptian-frame-french-plot.\n"}
