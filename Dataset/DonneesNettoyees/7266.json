The building's lift is malfunctioning, and they receive visits from unwanted callers: Katia, a depressed transvestite who wants to hit on Pierre, and Josette, a heavily pregnant woman on the run from her fianc\u00e9 F\u00e9lix. F\u00e9lix is working as a Santa Claus during the season and turns up on her trail in costume and brandishing a gun. F\u00e9lix and Josette, a caricature trailer trash couple, end up struggling over the gun and accidentally shooting dead the lift repairman, whom they then butcher and feed to zoo animals.\n"}
