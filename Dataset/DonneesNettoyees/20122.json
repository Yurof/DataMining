The small border town of Vila de Santiago, once a booming trade center for illegal trafficking, is about to become a ghost town, as a new motorway is to bypass the city and the railway station is being closed. Its stationmaster, Vincente, is preparing to retire. Many young people have moved out, leaving the children to be brought up by the elderly, including thirteen-year-old Gl\u00f3ria and her friend Ivan. Gl\u00f3ria's life suddenly changes with the arrival of Vincente's son, Mauro, who has just come out of prison and has some old issues to settle. Mauro begins to charge around the station on his motorbike, while Gl\u00f3ria's friendship with Ivan is put to test on account of her attraction to older Mauro.\n"}
