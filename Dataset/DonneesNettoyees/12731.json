Ramachandra Rao refuses to believe him, but his wife Janaki  lets him stay in their house. The couple test Rangadu in all possible ways but he never succumbs to any thing. Janaki\u2019s cousin brother Bhupati  stays in their house with his children, Nutan Prasad and Geeta and takes care of all their business affairs. He plans to let childless couple, Ramachandrarao and Janaki, adopt his son, so that he can grab their property.Unable to withstand Rangadu\u2019s claim as their son, Bhushanam too tries every trick possible to kick him out of the house, but fails. Meanwhile Rangadu manages to win over the couple\u2019s hearts and they decide to adopt him as their son. His grandmother gets this news and rushes to see him.Here, she reveals that Rangadu is Ramachandrarao\u2019s elder brother\u2019s son and how the couple saved Rangadu\u2019s mother. Bhushanam traps the family and tries to grab the property, but Rangadu rescues everyone..and in the effort, his cousin Radha gets killed. Chiru\u2019s action, especially his timing in comedy, and his fights standout in this movie.The climax fight, where chiru is dragged by horses was well shot and Chiranjeevi displays his skill in few breathtaking shots. Overall a neat entertainer for every movie lover.\n"}
