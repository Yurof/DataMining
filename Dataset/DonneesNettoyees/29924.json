Thigo gives Nick just 24 hours to pay back the \u00a3100,000 he owes him - and, just to make sure, holds Nick's wheelchair-using mother  as a hostage. Since Nick is already financially challenged, he is going to have to use his imagination to come up with the money. But Mr Thigo is stealing all his money he collects to make sure that he doesn't pay up, because if he kills the guy who owes him, other people will come in lines to pay him back.\n"}
