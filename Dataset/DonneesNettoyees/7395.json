{"wikiId": "31323955", "titre": "Der Lachende Mann - Bekenntnisse eines M\u00f6rders", "dateSortie": "1966", "duree": "", "genre": ["Documentary", "War film"], "resume": "Posing as West German journalists, East German documentary filmmakers Heynowski and Scheumann pay a visit to the notorious Nazi-turned-mercenary Siegfried \u201cKongo\u201d M\u00fcller, pump him with booze, and get him to talk. M\u00fcller fought in Congo\u2019s civil war in the 1960s, and the more Pernod he imbibes, the more fascinating this interview becomes. He asserts that blacks are no better than animals and shares his dream of enlisting in the U.S. Army to fight communism in Vietnam and beyond. He flaunts his military paraphernalia, including the Iron Cross he was awarded in Germany in 1945, and proceeds to deny his earlier statements about civil killings, the ethics of war, and the defense of Western libertarian values. This documentary tour-de-force is interspersed with pictures of M\u00fcller and his comrades proudly posing with severed skulls, and it touches on other Nazis who are active in Africa as well as American world dominance. -anthology film archives http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view07&year2011#showing-37679\n"}
