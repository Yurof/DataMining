Even after giving up her job as the town schoolteacher, Missie has found running the ranch on her own overwhelming, so she has resigned herself to letting her son Jeff and his new bride take control of it jointly with her brothers Aaron and Arnie. Missie and her ten-year-old son Mattie travel back to her hometown to live near the farm of her parents, Clark and Marty Davis. She goes back to teaching school. At her first Sunday service, Missie and Mattie learn from the attractive\u2014and single\u2014 Pastor Joe that an \u201cOrphan Train\u201d with homeless children in need of good homes will soon arrive from the Children\u2019s Aid Society of New York. Outside the church, Clark introduces Missie to sharp-tongued biddy Mrs. Pettis, who disdains the orphans as \"ragamuffins.\" At the same time, Missie catches the eye of a passing horseman: bachelor Sheriff Zach Tyler, another target of Mrs. Pettis\u2019 vitriol. Claiming that Zach is not a godly man, Mrs. Pettis passes her judgment on him, implying he has a shameful past on the wrong side of the law. On her way to work, Missie passes the church just as the orphan distribution is underway. Although she is firmly determined not to grant Mattie\u2019s request for a new sibling, she goes in\u2014just in time to witness 14-year-old Belinda behaving belligerently toward the Pettises as they choose eight-year-old Jacob\u2014looking on him as a farm worker rather than a son. Realizing that the lone orphan Belinda will be sent back to the foundling home in New York, Missie volunteers to adopt her. Unbeknownst to all, Belinda is Jacob\u2019s sister. She kept this secret to prevent potential parents from breaking up siblings because they see her as \"too old\" to adopt. With Jacob secured in a home nearby, Belinda can figure out a way for them to flee; she believes that their father had given them up for adoption with the full intention of reuniting with them in the near future. She is so sure of this that she resists family life within the loving embrace of Missie, the Davises, Zach, and the community; she sneaks out of Missie\u2019s home nightly to reassure Jacob that soon they will leave together. She becomes more determined after learning that the Pettises beat and starve him. Missie tells her mother Marty that she feels as if a voice inside told her to adopt Belinda, but she still can\u2019t explain why. Perhaps, says Marty, \u201cGod knew that Belinda needed you. And maybe, for some reason you don\u2019t understand yet, you need her.\u201d Joe attempts to court Missie, but she resists, explaining she could never love anyone the way she loved her late husband. Missie then struggles to convince herself that although she is not in love with the sheriff, at least he would make a good marriage partner. While Missie discusses Belinda\u2019s disturbing nocturnal disappearances with Zach, who has warmed her heart with his kindness toward the young girl, he states he has no faith in God if a child can suffer like Belinda. Later, Missie tells her mother she couldn\u2019t love a man who didn\u2019t share her faith. Zach and Missie discover Jacob\u2019s plight, but are anguished that they can\u2019t rescue him unless he exposes the Pettises, which he won\u2019t out of fear of reprisal. While Missie and Zach appreciate their mutual desire to help the boy, they clash over how to save him. An angry Belinda berates them for their inability to help Jacob, claiming her father will soon come to their aid. Exasperated by Belinda\u2019s rejection, Missie visits Marty, who reminds her that Missie once had trouble accepting Marty as her stepmother. Sagely, she tells Missie that \u201cloving a child has nothing to do with giving birth\u201d and \u201cbeing a family is a choice, not necessarily something that just happens because you\u2019re related by blood.\" Belinda shows Missie a note written by her father. Belinda can\u2019t read, but is sure the note explains how he\u2019ll come back for her and Jacob. Missie then reads her the note, and Belinda learns that her father had actually left them at the orphanage for good. Later, Zach visits Missie at the school to explain his lack of faith: his fianc\u00e9e was an innocent victim of murderous bank robbers. Missie then relates the story of her husband\u2019s death, but adds that she still can\u2019t be with a person who doesn\u2019t share her faith. After Missie again fails to rescue Jacob, Belinda runs away with him into the stormy night. Everyone joins a desperate search for them. Amid the lightning-laden thunderstorm, Zach prays. He then hears a voice over the din and follows it to the abandoned mine where the children have sought shelter. Zach tells Missie it was God\u2019s miracle that guided him in the wilderness, but as she later admits to her father, she doesn\u2019t know how to \u201clet go\u201d of her late husband. Clark tells her love doesn\u2019t die when a person passes away; it stays in a person's heart forever as she moves on to a new life with a new chance for happiness. Missie takes that chance by marrying Zach. They adopt Jacob as well and begin their lives as a family of five.\n"}
