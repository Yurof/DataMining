Who were its predecessors and what did they create? Compelled by the urge to get closer to the people in front of the camera, cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sprouted in a context of unprecedented creative freedom. Avant-garde techniques and the pioneering filmmakers behind them, notably National Film Board of Canada icon Michel Brault, set the stage for a new movie-making philosophy born in the \u201850s and \u201860s, a philosophy whose influence lives on in virtually every facet of today\u2019s media. Denys Desjardins recounts the story of a collective of rebel artists who revolutionized shooting and production methods within the backdrop of Quebec\u2019s Quiet Revolution. Interviews with forerunners Michel Brault, Roger Blais, Wolf Koenig, Denys Arcand, Marcel Carri\u00e8re, Roman Kroitor, Terence Macartney-Filgate, Fernand Dansereau, Claude Fournier, Jean-Claude Labrecque, Jacques Giraldeau, and others, revisit a pivotal turning point in the evolution of modern film.\n"}
