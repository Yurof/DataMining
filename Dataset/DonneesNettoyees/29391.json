{"wikiId": "8347090", "titre": "My Sweet Little Village", "dateSortie": "1985", "duree": "98.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Comedy"], "resume": "The movie's main storyline follows the life of Ot\u00edk, a mentally retarded young man, in a tight-knit village community. The sweet-tempered Ot\u00edk works as an assistant truck driver with Mr. P\u00e1vek, his older colleague and practical-minded neighbor. P\u00e1vek's family takes care of Ot\u00edk, whose parents are dead. However, the two coworkers become at odds over Ot\u00edk's inability to perform even the simplest tasks. P\u00e1vek demands that Ot\u00edk be transferred to assist another driver, who happens to be a choleric and suspicious man named Turek . Rather than work with Turek, Ot\u00edk decides to accept an offer of employment in Prague, but finds he does not fit in to the city life. After discovering that the transfer of Ot\u00edk to Prague was a trick by a crooked politician to get a deal on Ot\u00edk's large inherited house, P\u00e1vek agrees to give Ot\u00edk a second chance and retrieves him from the city to resume their work together. The film also follows several subplots, such as the secret romance of Turek's wife with a young vet, the tribulations of an accident-prone but respected doctor who has almost as much trouble with his pessimistic patients as he does with his car, and the desperate deeds of P\u00e1vek's teenage son, who has ardent feelings for an attractive local teacher.\n"}
