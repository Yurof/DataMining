Men begin to swarm around, but none she feels is Mr. Right until she meets a crooner at a local club . The plot thickens when she also meets an old high-school friend, now a wealthy but muscle-bound hunk . Typical situations follow, such as a scene where she stands up Bubl\u00e9 for a date with Hutzler, and Bubl\u00e9 ends up making out with her girlfriend played by Maeve Quinlan. In the rather contrived ending, everything ends happily.\n"}
