{"wikiId": "33589235", "titre": "Sagat: The Documentary", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "80.0", "genre": ["Documentary"], "resume": "The 60-minutes documentary follows Sagat's working career with a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse into the cult actor's performances, and gives plenty of testimonials about Sagat's impact. Most of the shooting was done in Cognac, Paris and San Francisco. The film contains many quotations from other notables from the industry including Chi Chi LaRue who compares Sagat with the pop diva Madonna, and porn filmmaker Bruce LaBruce who calls Sagat \"the Marilyn Monroe of gay porn -- Marilyn had her breasts, Fran\u00e7ois has the ass\". In this uncensored docu-portrait, the pornstar is engaged with a mixture of candor and quite touching fragility. And is not afraid to talk about his fears or cracks. An endearing look at a gay icon like no other. Very notably, he declares towards the end of the documentary: \"Je pense que je vais arr\u00eater le porno\" .T\u00eatu: \"Sagat\", le docu: \"J'aimerais arr\u00eater le porno\"\n"}
