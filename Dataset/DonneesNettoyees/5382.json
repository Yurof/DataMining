His wife Yvonne  pleads with a surgeon to try and save Orlac\u2019s hands. The surgeon decides to try and transplant new hands onto Orlac, but the hands he uses are those of a recently-executed murderer named Vasseur. From that point forward, the pianist is tortured by the presence of a knife he finds at his house, just like that used by Vassuer, and the desire to kill. He believes that along with the murderer\u2019s hands, he has also gained the murderer's predisposition to violence. He confronts the surgeon, telling him to remove the hands, but the surgeon tries to convince him that a person\u2019s acts are not governed by hands, but by the head and heart. Orlac\u2019s new hands are unable to play the piano, and in time he and his wife run out of money. Creditors give them one more day to pay their bills. Yvonne goes to Paul\u2019s father for money, but is refused. Orlac himself then goes to see his father, but finds he has been stabbed to death with the same knife like Vasseur's. He starts to think he himself committed the murder, and goes to a caf\u00e9 for a drink. There he meets a man who claims he is Vasseur, who tells Orlac the same surgeon who did the hand transplant also transplanted a new head into Vasseur\u2019s body. He then tells Orlac he wants money to keep quiet about the murder. In the meantime, police find Vasseur\u2019s finger prints at the scene of the crime, causing confusion. Paul and Yvonne Orlac decide to go to the police and try to explain about Vasseur\u2019s hands being on Paul\u2019s arms, but that he had no recollection of killing his father. He also tells the police about the man claiming to be the executed murderer, and the blackmail money. It turns out that the man is actually a con man, well known to police. The Orlac maid tells the police that he was a friend of Vasseur, and that he had made a set of rubber gloves with Vasseur\u2019s finger prints on them. The gloves were used during the murder.\n"}
