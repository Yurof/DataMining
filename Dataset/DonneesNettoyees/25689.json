He confesses to the priest in front of his friends; he insists that the doctor be truthful. But, he cannot bring himself to tell his son C\u00e9sariot that his real father is Marius, the absent son of C\u00e9sar, C\u00e9sariot's godfather. Panisse leaves that to Fanny, the lad's mother. Dissembling that he's off to see a friend, C\u00e9sariot then seeks Marius, now a mechanic in Toulon. Posing as a journalist, C\u00e9sariot spends time with Marius and leaves believing tales he is a petty thief. Only after the truth comes out can Marius, Fanny, C\u00e9sar, and C\u00e9sariot step beyond the falsehoods, benign though they may be.\n"}
