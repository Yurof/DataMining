Nazi officers want to organize a football match for Hitler's birthday, in which Germans would play against Hungarian prisoners of war. They call for the famous Hungarian footballer, \u00d3n\u00f3di, and order him to organize a team. \u00d3n\u00f3di accepts, but in turn demands extra food, a ball with which he and his team can train before the match, and asks that they be allowed to concentrate on training before the match and not work. The Germans accept all the demands, but recommend \u00d3n\u00f3di not include any Jews in his team. However, \u00d3n\u00f3di can't organize the team only from his company, because only 8 out of 98 soldiers can play football. Therefore \u00d3n\u00f3di recruits players from the other company. One of the players is Steiner, who is a Jew and can't play football. He lied to \u00d3n\u00f3di because he was afraid to die. During training the footballers subdue the German corporal guarding them and try to escape. They are soon recaptured and told they will now face probable death penalty. However, the Germans order the Hungarian team to still play the match. At the beginning of the match \u00d3n\u00f3di and his team are discouraged, as the Germans easily score three goals. The Hungarians succeed in scoring one goal and the first half ends 3-1 in favour of Germany. At the interval the German commander tells the Hungarians that they might not be executed if they lose the match. The Hungarians refuse to believe this. At the beginning of the second half they score three goals. As a result, during the match, they are executed by the Germans.\n"}
