{"wikiId": "21249876", "titre": "Too Much is Enough", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "", "genre": ["Documentary"], "resume": "Too Much is Enough pays homage to Gilles Groulx , considered by many to be one of Quebec\u2019s most important and original filmmakers. Tragically, Groulx\u2019s career was cut short in 1981 after he was seriously injured in a car accident. From 1989 to 1994, Richard Brouillette met regularly with Groulx, recording the latter\u2019s thoughts on his work and life. Too Much is Enough combines footage from these sessions, excerpts from Groulx\u2019s films and interviews Groulx gave while at the peak of his career.\n"}
