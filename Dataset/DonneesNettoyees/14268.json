The weather is bitterly cold  but no snow has fallen. Despite this, hundreds of bewildered men stand around a circus trailer  in the main square, waiting to see the main attraction \u2014 the stuffed carcass of a whale. The men composing this faceless, ragged crowd have come from distant parts of the country as well as neighbouring settlements, and the strange state of affairs \u2014 the presence of strangers, the extreme cold \u2014 is disturbing the order of the small town. Relationships are changing, and some ambitious people feel they can take advantage of the situation; while others who are more passive fall into even deeper uncertainty. The unbearable tension is brought to a head by the figure of the Prince, a disfigured, Slovak-speaking figure, who is hiding behind the whale; his mere appearance is enough to unleash destructive emotions. The ensuing apocalypse spares no one.\n"}
