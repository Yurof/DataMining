The arrival of Firmino, a former inhabitant who moved to Salvador, running away from poverty, transforms the peaceable panorama of the place, and polarizes tensions. Firmino is attracted to Quota, but he is not able to forget Na\u00edna who, on her part, likes Aru\u00e3. Firmino orders dispatch against Aru\u00e3, that isn\u2019t attained, in opposite to the village that sees the cut net, impeding the fishing. Firmino stirs up the fishermen to revolt against the owner of the net, coming to destroy it. Policemen arrive at the village to control the equipment. In his fight against exploitation, Firmino argues against the master, mediator between the fishermen and the owner of the net. A fisherman convinces Aru\u00e3 of fishing without the net, since his chastity would make him a protected man of Iemanj\u00e1. The fishermen are successful in their piecework, under the leadership of Aru\u00e3. Na\u00edna reveals her impossible love for Aru\u00e3 to an old black woman. In his defeat against mysticism, Firmino convinces Quota of taking away Aru\u00e3\u2019s virginity, and consequently breaking the religious enchantment that makes him a protected man of Iemanj\u00e1. Aru\u00e3 takes the bait. A storm announces the \u201cbarravento\u201d, the violent moment. The fishermen leave for the sea, two of them die, Vicente and Chico. Firmino denounces Aru\u00e3\u2019s loss of chastity. The Master reneges. The dead bodies are guarded, and Na\u00edna accepts to make the ritual, so she can marry Aru\u00e3. He promises the marriage, but before he decides to leave for the city to work and to earn money for the purchase of a new net. In the same place where Firmino arrived at the village, Aru\u00e3 leaves for the city.\n"}
