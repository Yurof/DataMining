While they are being transported, a German air attack hits the convoy, killing most of the prisoners, but allowing the five surviving prisoners to fight off the escorting MPs and escape. The group decides to make their escape to neutral Switzerland, but on the way they end up volunteering for a commando mission to steal the new prototype gyroscope for the Nazi V2 with help of the French resistance. Somehow the team must sneak onto the most heavily guarded train in German territory, steal the Nazis' most precious military hardware, and bring it back to the Allies without getting arrested again by their own side.\n"}
