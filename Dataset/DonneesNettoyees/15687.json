He meets up with the town's evil employer, Pink Gresham,  who abuses the men and has affairs with the women. Pink toys with Baston's plight but keeps the upper hand with his pistol and chases Baston away. Baston then meets Pink's wife, Maggie , and spins a tale of her husbands philandering and Pink's personal involvement with Baston's affairs at his hometown in the next county.
