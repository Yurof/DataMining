Tom Collier, Leslie Howard, is a book publisher, who has been living in the city with his best friend, Daisy Sage, Ann Harding, without being married. His wealthy Father, Rufus Collier, Henry Stephenson, wants him to live a respectable life. While Daisy is away, with her work, Cecilia, Myrna Loy, convinces Tom to marry her. Although, their lawyer and friend, Owen, Neil Hamilton, is in love with her; he doesn\u2019t have enough financial resources to maintain her interest. Cecilia tries to get Tom to \u201csell out\u201d, without his realizing it. She talks him into publishing books that will make money, get rid of his old friends, including \u201cRed\u201d, his prize-fighter friend and butler. She wants Tom to sell his publishing company, live in the city, with his Father, as a \"proper gentleman\", and take their place in society, which Tom has been fighting all his life; but, is all \u201cCee\u201d cares about. Daisy tries to stay away; but, she and Tom\u2019s Bohemian friends can\u2019t believe he\u2019s happy. She loves him deeply, and wants to have children with him; but, cares most about his well-being. Tom complains that he's losing his soul and integrity. Finally, when Cee offers Tom champagne, to toast selling his publishing company and moving in with his Father, Tom realizes that Cee\u2019s bedroom suite reminds him of a brothel he used to go, as he says, \"in vino veritas\". When Red tells Tom he is going back to the city, that he can\u2019t stomach anymore, Tom agrees, saying, he\u2019s \u201cgoing back to his wife,\u201d Daisy. As he leaves, he put a little something on the mantle for Cee, just as he used to, with the girls, in the bordello.   The text of the play, from 1932, is available from Gutenberg. The play emphasizes the estrangement between Tom and his Father, who has never visited his son's house, before; and, that Owen, his one \"respectable gentleman\" friend, introduced Cee to Tom.\n"}
