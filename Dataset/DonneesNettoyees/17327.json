She arrives at the southern French seaport of Toulon to attend the wedding of her older sister Ma\u00eft\u00e9 to Nourredine, a north African. However, her main goal is to repatriate her deaf-mute younger brother Alain with whom she had been living following the death of their parents. Alain, however has run away with Sa\u00efd, a French man of Algerian descent who approached Jeanne on her arrival in the city. Alain supports himself as a pickpocket under the tutelage of Sa\u00efd. Jeanne must therefore locate her brother. Jeanne's first lead in finding her brother is the struggling orchestra conductor Klotz, a bisexual older man who is infatuated with Sa\u00efd. When Jeanne visits Klotz's luxurious beach-side villa she meets Klot'z son St\u00e9phane, who is recovering from a coma, and St\u00e9phane's overbearing mother, Myrian. When Jeanne finds Alain, she moves into the modest hotel he shares with Sa\u00efd, which is run by a repatriated Pied-Noir from Algeria. At the same time Jeanne starts a relationship with St\u00e9phane, but there is a secret link between St\u00e9phane and Sa\u00efd. Sa\u00efd takes Jeanne to see a burns victim and reveals to her that St\u00e9phane had once been part of a far right racist gang which had set fire to an immigrant hostel, and was later stabbed by Sa\u00efd in revenge. During a brief stay in Algeria, Sa\u00efd telephones St\u00e9phane to tell him of the night he has spent with Jeanne, which motivates St\u00e9phane to denounce Sa\u00efd to the racist gang. However, St\u00e9phane catches up with Sa\u00efd and warns him not to go back to the hotel. Sa\u00efd, however, drags St\u00e9phane with him and they are both shot dead. The film ends with Jeanne staring at the two bodies.\n"}
