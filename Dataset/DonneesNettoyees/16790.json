One group member, Jir\u014d Sugita , harasses one of the girls which invokes an extended verbal rebuke. Jir\u014d leaves the group and returns home where he lives with his single mother, Misayo . She is the mistress of Keigo Nanbara , a business man, both of whom Jir\u014d is constantly at odds with. Jir\u014d gets in a fight with Nanbara, tears violently through the house and steals some money. Another girl from the group, Toshimi Tani , has a crush on Jir\u014d. The two start a physical relationship but Jir\u014d is decidedly cooler towards the affair. At Misayo's request, Nanbara lectures Jir\u014d about his disreputable lifestyle and relationship but is met with mockery. The following day, Nanbara and Misayo, as well as Jir\u014d and his friends, go to a Zushi beach resort. Jir\u014d convinces one friend, Etsuko , to seduce Nanbara. Toshimi then leads Misayo to the bedroom where Nanbara and Etsuko are having their tryst. Jir\u014d observes his mother's distress and is wracked with guilt. He and Toshimi steal a convertible and speed away. Nanbara catches up with them at a rest stop and, in a struggle, Jir\u014d brutally assaults Nanbara with a wrench, nearly killing him. The two continue their frantic flight only to collide with a truck, dying soon afterward. A crowd has gathered around the wreck when Misayo arrives. An observer mutters, \"Everything went wrong.\"\n"}
