Dant\u00e8s and Mondego are chased by English Dragoons who believe they are spies for the exiled Napoleon Bonaparte. The Emperor declares they are not his agents, and asks Dant\u00e8s to give a letter to a friend in France. After the captain dies, they are sent on their way. Dant\u00e8s is reprimanded by the ship's first mate, Danglars, for disobeying orders. However, the shipping company's boss, Morrell, commends Dant\u00e8s' bravery, promoting him to captain over Danglars. Mondego intercepts Dant\u00e8s' fianc\u00e9e, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, and tries to seduce her. When he hears of Dant\u00e8s' promotion, Mondego realizes that Dant\u00e8s will be able to marry Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s sooner than expected. Mondego gets drunk and tells Danglars about the letter Napoleon gave Dant\u00e8s. Danglars has Dant\u00e8s charged with treason and sent to magistrate J.F. Villefort. Villefort is sure of Dant\u00e8s' innocence, but discovers the addressee is Villefort's father, Clarion, a Bonapartist, whom he denounced to secure a promotion. Villefort burns the letter and fools Dant\u00e8s into submitting to arrest, then attempts to send him to an island prison, Ch\u00e2teau d'If. Dant\u00e8s escapes and goes to Mondego for help, but Mondego wounds him so he cannot escape; when Dant\u00e8s asks why he betrayed their friendship, Mondego says that he is angry that he wants to be Dant\u00e8s despite his wealth and superior social position. Dant\u00e8s is imprisoned in the Ch\u00e2teau d'If. Meanwhile, news spreads that Napoleon has escaped from Elba. Mondego, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, Morrell and Dant\u00e8s' father go to Villefort to plead that Dant\u00e8s is innocent, but Villefort rejects their efforts. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s thanks Mondego for his support, but after she leaves Mondego and Villefort discuss their reasons for imprisoning Dant\u00e8s. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s is told that Dant\u00e8s has been executed. In prison, Dant\u00e8s befriends Abb\u00e9 Faria, a priest and former soldier in Napoleon's army. Faria was imprisoned because he claimed not to know the location of the deceased Count Spada's fortune. For 13 years Faria educates Dantes, teaching him mathematics, literature, philosophy, economics, hand and sword combat and military strategy. While escaping, their tunnel caves in, mortally wounding Faria, who gives Dant\u00e8s the location of Spada's treasure. When the guards put the priest into a body bag, Dant\u00e8s removes the corpse, hides himself in the bag and is thrown into the sea. Dant\u00e8s washes onto a desert island and encounters Luigi Vampa, a smuggler and thief. Vampa persuades Dant\u00e8s to fight Jacopo, a traitor whom they intended to bury alive. Dant\u00e8s defeats Jacopo but makes a deal with Vampa to let him live; Jacopo vows to serve Dant\u00e8s for the rest of his life. Dant\u00e8s joins the smugglers for three months, leaving when they arrive at Marseilles. Not recognizing him, Morrell tells Dant\u00e8s that his father committed suicide upon learning of his imprisonment and that Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s has married Mondego. Danglars took over Morrell's shipping company after Morrell made him a partner. Dant\u00e8s goes to the island of Monte Cristo, finds Spada's treasure and vows revenge on Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, Mondego, Danglars and Villefort. Dant\u00e8s becomes the \"Count of Monte Cristo\". He hires Vampa to stage a kidnapping of Mondego's son Albert and then \"rescues\" him, inviting the boy to his residence. In return, Albert invites the count to his sixteenth birthday at the Mondegos' residence. Dant\u00e8s meets with Villefort to discuss a shipment of unspecified property. Mondego meets with Villefort later that evening and mentions that his son heard Monte Cristo use the words gold, shipment and Spada. They believe the shipment is treasure and plot to steal it. At the party, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s recognizes Dant\u00e8s, with whom she is still in love. Jacopo allows her to hide in Monte Cristo's carriage to speak with him, wanting his master to abandon his obsession with revenge and simply live his life. Dant\u00e8s does not admit to being her former lover, but accidentally says 'Edmond Dant\u00e8s'; Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s had never mentioned Edmond's last name. Dant\u00e8s confronts Danglars with the police in tow; Danglars fights Dant\u00e8s, who reveals his true identity before having Danglars arrested. Dant\u00e8s gets Villefort to confess that he persuaded Mondego to kill Clarion in return for telling Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s that Dant\u00e8s was executed. Villefort is charged with conspiracy to murder, and realizes Monte Cristo's true identity before being imprisoned. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s admits that she still loves Dant\u00e8s. After spending the night together, Dant\u00e8s decides to take Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s and her son and leave France. Dant\u00e8s has Mondego's debts called in, bankrupting him. Mondego is also due to be arrested for Piracy, Corruption, and Murder. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s confronts Mondego, revealing she is leaving him and Albert is Dant\u00e8s' son; she only married him and claimed that the boy was born prematurely to hide his true paternity. Mondego leaves for his family estate, where the stolen gold shipment was to be taken. He finds that the chests are filled with dirt and sand, and that Dant\u00e8s has arrived to take his revenge. Albert rushes to defend Mondego, until Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s reveals to Dant\u00e8s and Albert that they are father and son. Mondego attempts to kill Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, but only wounds her, as Jacopo throws off his aim. Mondego fights Dant\u00e8s, and Dant\u00e8s impales Mondego through the heart, killing him. Dant\u00e8s returns to Ch\u00e2teau d'If to pay homage to Faria and promises him that he has given up on revenge and will live a better life. He leaves the island with Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, Albert and Jacopo.\n"}
