His mother, Deidre , perceiving an ill-fated upbringing, places him under the care of her unorthodox psychiatrist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox , the eccentric patriarch of an oddball family. At the age of 12, Burroughs  finds himself in Victorian squalor living an unconventional youth among the doctor\u2019s family, and is subject to irregular visits by his increasingly unsound mother. At one point, Burroughs befriends Neil Bookman , Finch's adopted 33-year-old son, and the two enter an erratic sexual relationship. The story is of a childhood in which the boundary between reality and fantasy is ignored and finally broken; as, ultimately, is the irreplaceable bond between mother and son.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439289/\n"}
