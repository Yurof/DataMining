Set in the bowels of an iconic derelict Los Angeles high-rise, we follow Lauren and her real-estate investing fianc\u00e9 as they discover first hand what happens when a madman leads not with emotion, but rather chilling rationality. The Man in question brings a heaping helping of sanity and jet-black humor to the crazy table. The result is a wonderfully off-kilter horror/thriller that never goes where we expect, but rather draws the audience deeper into a surprising world that has dark corners even in the brightest rooms.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1415284/.html\n"}
