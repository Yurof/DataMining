She brings Vincent clean clothes, and puts money in his canteen account. She and Vincent obviously still need each other sexually, and it is difficult for both of them to be separated. One day Ma\u00eft\u00e9 is approached by a young man named Jean , who says his brother is also incarcerated for 7 years. They quickly embark on a sexual relationship, but Ma\u00eft\u00e9 is cold and unresponsive. She has a good relationship with her neighbour, Djamila, who has a small son, Julien. Ma\u00eft\u00e9 looks after him frequently whilst Djamila is at work, and the two are close. Eventually Ma\u00eft\u00e9 discovers that Jean is in fact a guard at her husband's prison. The affair takes a turn when Vincent finds out; instead of stopping them, he insists Jean tape their meetings. He advises Jean how to move Ma\u00eft\u00e9 emotionally and sexually, however, Jean tells him \"she is empty\". As Jean falls in love with Ma\u00eft\u00e9, she tries to distance herself from both of them. However as Jean leaves to take up a post in Lille, Vincent attempts suicide and in final scene she is seen walking confidently into the prison to visit him once again.\n"}
