{"wikiId": "33262964", "titre": "The Lords of Salem", "dateSortie": "2012", "duree": "", "genre": ["Horror"], "resume": "Heidi DJs at the local radio station, and together with the two Hermans  forms part of the \u2018Big H Radio Team\u2019. A mysterious wooden box containing a vinyl record arrives for Heidi, \"a gift from the Lords\". She assumes it's a rock band on a mission to spread their word. As Heidi and Whitey play the Lords\u2019 record, it starts to play backwards, and Heidi experiences a flashback to a past trauma. Later, Whitey plays the Lords\u2019 record, dubbing them the Lords of Salem, and to his surprise, the record plays normally and is a massive hit with listeners. The arrival of another wooden box from the Lords presents the Big H team with free tickets, posters and records to host a gig in Salem. Soon Heidi and her cohorts find that the gig is far from the rock spectacle they\u2019re expecting; the original Lords of Salem are returning, and they\u2019re out for blood.\n"}
