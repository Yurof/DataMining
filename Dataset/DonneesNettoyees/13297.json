The group comprises a mixture of men from different parts of Sweden: Roland J\u00e4rverup, a timid dansband fan from Karlskoga, the easy-going pick-up artists Micke and Slobodan from Sk\u00f6vde, who has grown tired of the local women, Magnus Ronell, a socially awkward and aggressive perpetual student, Lennart Sundstr\u00f6m, an idealistic and outspoken sanitary worker who lives with his elderly mother in V\u00e4nn\u00e4s, and several others. The bus is driven by Lasse Kongo, a severely alcoholic man with unintelligible speech. Once the group arrive in Paldiski, in the vicinity of Tallinn, a speed-dating system is put into practice, followed by dancing later at night. Awkward and tragicomic situations occur as most of the characters fail to connect with each other and behave properly. Eventually, after various achievements or non-achievements, the men reenter the bus and return to Sweden.\n"}
