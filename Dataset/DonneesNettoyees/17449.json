{"wikiId": "13605482", "titre": "Holly", "dateSortie": "2007", "duree": "113.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Indie"], "resume": "Patrick , an American card shark and dealer of stolen artifacts, has been \u2018comfortably numb\u2019 in Cambodia for years, when he encounters Holly , a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl, in the K11 red light village. The girl has been sold by her impoverished family and smuggled across the border to work as a prostitute. Holly\u2019s virginity makes her a lucrative prize, and when she is sold to a child trafficker, Patrick embarks on a frantic search through the both beautiful and sordid faces of the country, in an attempt to bring her to safety. Harsh, yet poetic, this feature forms part of the \u2018K-11\u2019 Project, utilizing mass media to raise awareness of the global child trafficking epidemic. The producers are executing the K-11 Project in conjunction with their non-profit, the Redlight Children Campaign, which is a worldwide grassroots initiative generating conscious concern and inspiring immediate action against child sexploitation.\n"}
