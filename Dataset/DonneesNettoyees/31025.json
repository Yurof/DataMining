Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler  is conducting Beethoven's 5th Symphony when yet another Allied bomb raid stops the performance. A minister in Hitler's government comes to Furtw\u00e4ngler's dressing room to advise him that he should go abroad, and escape the war. The film then jumps to some time after the Allied victory, and we see US General Wallace  task Major Steve Arnold  with \"getting\" Furtw\u00e4ngler at his denazification hearing: \"Find Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany\".From film audio, 6 minutes into the film. Arnold gets an office with Lt. David Wills , a German-American Jew, and Emmaline Straube , daughter of an executed member of the German resistance. Arnold questions several musicians, many of whom know Emmaline's father and say that Furtw\u00e4ngler refused to give Hitler the Nazi salute. Arnold begins interrogating Furtw\u00e4ngler, asking why he didn't leave Germany in 1933 like so many other musicians? Why he played for Hitler's birthday? Why he played at a Nazi rally? And why his recording of Bruckner's 7th Symphony was used on the radio after Hitler's death? Arnold gets a second violinist to tell him about Furtw\u00e4ngler's womanizing and the conductor's professional jealousy of Herbert von Karajan. In a sub plot, Arnold is assisted by a young Jewish lieutenant from the Big Red One. The young officer begins to have sympathy for the conductor as well as for the young German girl who works as a clerk in their office. This causes friction between Arnold and his job investigating former suspected Nazis. In a voice-over, Arnold explains that Furtw\u00e4ngler was exonerated at the later hearings but boasts his questioning \"winged\" him. The film closes with actual footage of the real Furtw\u00e4ngler shaking hands with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels after a concert. A close-up then shows the conductor surreptitiously wiping his hands with a cloth after touching the Nazi.\n"}
