Having previously believed that the building burned to the ground years ago, Brian travels there with a group of friends and meets Haley, a mysterious friend of his mother, who acts as their guide through the impressive, monastery-like building. During their tour it becomes clear that something sinister lies beneath the surface. Despite their misgivings, they follow a secret passageway underground and come across strange and unsettling discoveries that trigger Brian\u2019s disturbing memories of his mother\u2019s research. Ultimately, they are confronted by her terrible secret: Brian\u2019s mother built a revolutionary machine that cured people of their addictions but, as a side effect, those addictions materialized in the form of mutant children hungry for human flesh. Sharing the dark bowels of the building with swarms of firefly-like creatures that they use to lure their victims into death traps, the mutant children begin a wild hunt, with the new visitors as their prey. Fighting to stay alive against the inconceivable, Brian and his friends soon realize that some things are better left hidden.\n"}
