Yet, cars, telephones and other modern technology also exist in this world. Witch Hunt takes place in the 1950s during the red scare, in which magic is substituted for communism. It is a sequel to the HBO-produced film Cast a Deadly Spell. Hopper plays Lovecraft in place of Fred Ward. Additionally, many characters have different background stories then Cast a Deadly Spell. For example, Lovecraft refuses to use magic in Cast a Deadly Spell on principle, and because of a bad experience in Witch Hunt.\n"}
