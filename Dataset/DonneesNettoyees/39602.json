He teams with four people, Rick , Shannon  and Henson  whom he considers as his family and a young woman with unknown origins named Mary , while walking down a deserted road. They soon seek refuge in a seemingly abandoned farmhouse in the countryside due to Henson\u2019s deteriorating condition. The men assign the two women to be the watchers outside while they stay in the house. Mary tries to wash her clothing in a river being chased by a man whom she eventually kills with a rifle. Meanwhile, back in the house, the men discover food supplies in the basement only to discover it is a trap which kills Rick. Sensing danger, the two women head back to the house to hear loud siren and be attacked by two intruders; one of which recognizes Mary as part of their clan. The women successfully eliminate the intruders before Shannon, who overheard Mary\u2019s conversation with one of the intruders, knocks Mary unconscious. The three restrain Mary in a chair and continuously threaten her by beating her up until she tells to them who she really is. When she doesn\u2019t speak, Adam, furious over Rick\u2019s death, punches and cuts off Mary\u2019s skin with a tribal marking in her thigh. Mary eventually gives in and tells Adam that she was responsible for killing her wife and her daughter since she had to survive. She also tells the group that her former clan who killed her sister is coming for them. After listening to Mary\u2019s story, the three then reconsider her to the group and burn Rick\u2019s body. Meanwhile, the hostile clan\u2019s leader  swears to bring back what\u2019s theirs. The four starts to barricade the entire house as they prepare themselves for an incoming battle. At night, the opposing clan invades the house where the four start to shoot them through the windows but Henson is captured and killed. The leader\u2019s enmity fuels up even more when Shannon unintentionally shoots at his little son leaving his daughter to avenge for her brother\u2019s death. In the morning, Mary insists Shannon and Adam to leave and confronts the remaining survivors only to realize Shannon had taken the bullets from her shotgun. Mary gets overpowered by the leader not long before Adam comes back to help her fight off the hostile predators. Meanwhile, Shannon\u2019s throat is slashed by the leader\u2019s daughter, killing her. Back in the farmhouse, Mary sets Adam's body on fire after he dies from his wounds and encounters the leader\u2019s daughter who tries to deceive Mary as an innocent girl. Before the little girl attempts to follow and kill her, Mary decapitates her and flees from the burning farmhouse.\n"}
