It is inspired by real events, starting from the loss of the 1983 America's Cup through the events of the 1987 America's Cup. Several of the 12-metre class yachts that participated in the Cup races were repainted and used in the movie. The boat and team representing the US to win used the name Geronimo in their comeback and take back the cup from Australia. Added authenticity was provided by New Zealand's long time America's Cup commentator Peter Montgomery.\n"}
