{"wikiId": "2140657", "titre": "Azadi", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "29.0", "genre": ["Short Film"], "resume": "Every year, thousands of people set sail for Australian shores seeking asylum \u2013 seeking protection \u2013 seeking freedom. Some find it. Others end up in Woomera \u2013 or one of the many formidable, desert bound detention centres hidden from view in remote corners of the Australian outback. Azadi follows the plight of an Afghan schoolteacher and his asthmatic son, who escape their oppressive homeland only to encounter another kind of persecution upon arrival in Australia.\n"}
