Ana is seduced by Tom\u00e1s, who is also her ex-boyfriend, which causes Carlos to kick Tom\u00e1s out of their home. Although instead of Tom\u00e1s leaving, Ana leaves and moves across the street to the apartment of their friends Miguel  and Andrea , another couple going through problems. The situation becomes a battle of the sexes when Miguel is kicked-out for cheating on Andrea and sent to live with the \"guys\" across the street and Mar\u00eda , their friend, joins the \"girls\" in a boycott against all men. Tomas then has a fling with Andrea and gets caught in the act. After seeing the emptiness of his life, punctuated with him making a scene at a local nightclub, Tomas declares his love for Ana before apparently committing suicide by walking into an elevator shaft. In the Region 4 DVD version, several alternate final scenes are explored, including Tomas surviving the fall and emerging in a full body cast.\n"}
