Weber\u2019s film traces the man\u2019s career from the 1950s, playing with jazz greats like Charlie Parker, Gerry Mulligan, and Russ Freeman, to the 1980s, when his heroin addiction and domestic indifference kept him in Europe. By juxtaposing these two decades, Weber presents a sharp contrast between the younger, handsome Baker \u2014 the statuesque idol who resembled a mix of James Dean and Jack Kerouac \u2014 to what he became, \u201ca seamy looking drugstore cowboy-cum-derelict,\u201d as J. Hoberman put it in his Village Voice review.<ref name Hoberman | first  | title  Village Voice | pages  | publisher  April 25, 1989 | url  }} Let\u2019s Get Lost begins near the end of Baker\u2019s life, on the beaches of Santa Monica, and ends at the Cannes Film Festival. Weber uses these moments in the present as bookends to the historic footage contained in the bulk of the film. The documentation ranges from vintage photographs by William Claxton in 1953 to appearances on The Steve Allen Show and kitschy, low budget Italian films Baker did for quick money.\n"}
