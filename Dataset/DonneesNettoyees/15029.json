After setting flight records, she embarks on a top-secret mission. Although she is in love with fellow aviator Randy Britton , he does not approve of the flight, nor does her flight instructor, Paul Turner , as it involves flying over Japanese held territory in the Pacific. Carter vanishes during the latter part of the world flight, triggering a massive search which proves fruitless.\n"}
