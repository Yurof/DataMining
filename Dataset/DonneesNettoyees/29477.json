It is based on the creative processes and performances of the stage production. Using hip hop, Afrikaaps, the film and the stage play, breaks ground by boldly attempting to reclaim Afrikaans&nbsp;\u2013 so long considered a language of the oppressor&nbsp;\u2013 as a language of liberation. Present from the very beginning of the project, Dylan Valley captures revealing moments of the cast's and production crew\u2019s personal narratives that transcend what happens on stage.\n"}
