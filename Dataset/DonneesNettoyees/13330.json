His life takes an unexpected dark turn when his son Farid converts to fundamentalist Islam, leading to a family breakdown and social conflict. According to Rachel Donadio, a New York Times writer and editor, the film's theme is encapsulated in a pivotal scene: One of the most revealing insights into Britain\u2019s recent social history comes early in \u201cMy Son the Fanatic,\u201d Hanif Kureishi\u2019s tender and darkly prescient 1997 film. It\u2019s morning in an unnamed city in northern England, and Parvez, a secular Pakistani immigrant taxi driver brilliantly portrayed by Om Puri, watches Farid, his increasingly devout college-age son, sell his electric guitar. \u201cWhere is that going?\u201d Parvez asks Farid as the buyer drives off. \u201cYou used to love making a terrible noise with these instruments!\u201d Farid, played by Akbar Kurtha, looks at his father with irritation. \u201cYou always said there were more important things than \u2018Stairway to Heaven,\u2019 \u201d he says impatiently in his thick northern English accent. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been more right.\u201d<ref name2&orefbooks&pagewantedslogin NYT Profile]\".
