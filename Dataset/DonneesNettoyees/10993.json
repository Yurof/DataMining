A carefree Sylvester walks into the circus singing his theme \"Meow!\" where he visits the various animal exhibits. There, upon seeing the lion exhibit, the unimpressed cat immediately expresses his displeasure over the large feline's billing. However, Sylvester is far more interested in Tweety ... and thus the chase begins. Tweety runs into the big top, where the lion  is waiting to maul Sylvester for his earlier remarks . From this point forward, the lion serves as both an antagonist for Sylvester and a protecter of Tweety. Sylvester tries beating what he thinks is a fire hose to free Tweety, unknowing that the \"hose\" is an elephant's trunk. The elephant grabs Sylvester with his trunk and\u2014after crushing his chest\u2014throws the battered puss into the lion's cage, where the lion finishes the job. Other run-ins with the lion, elephant and other animals\u2014all ending with Sylvester getting the worst of things\u2014involve him exploiting his abilities as a high diver (Tweety directs the elephant to \"drink it all down\" , a fire eater  and a high-wire walker. In the end, Sylvester finally gets rid of the lion ... only to unwittingly lock himself in a cage with even more lions . Tweety immediately takes a hat and cane and becomes a carnival barker  A loud roar erupts, and with Sylvester presumably having met his fate, Tweety changes his spiel: \"Step wight up! Fifty wions, count 'em, fifty wions!\"\n"}
