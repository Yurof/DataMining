In the prelude to the Franco-Dutch War, a financially struggling Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9 is visited by King Louis XIV for three days of festivities at the Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly. The prince wants a commission as a general, and spares no expense in order to impress the king. In charge of organizing the event is Fran\u00e7ois Vatel, Master of Festivities and Pleasures in the prince's household. Vatel is a man of great honor and talent, but of low birth. As the great Cond\u00e9 is prepared to do anything in his quest for stature, the tasks assigned to Vatel are often menial and dishonourable. While Vatel tries to sustain dignity amidst the extravaganza he is meant to orchestrate, he finds himself in love with Anne de Montausier, the king's latest lover, who returns his affections. However, due to their incompatible social standing and the rigid hierarchy of the court, continuing the liaison is clearly impossible. The movie ends with Vatel realizing that he is nothing more than a puppet in the hands of his superiors, bought and sold like a piece of property: he consequently commits suicide by impaling himself on his sword. Anne de Montausier is grief-stricken upon hearing the news but she must not speak of it.\n"}
