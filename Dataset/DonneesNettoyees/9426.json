Marlene Dietrich plays a woman with a lot of class, but no money to satisfy her taste for the best things in life. She is dazzled by Count Della Fiabe, who is also trying to recuperate his debts at the gambling tables of the famous casino. To attract the woman, who he thinks is his meal ticket, the poor Italian noble man enlists the help of the same people to whom he owes money. The film's most famous scene comes toward the end when Marlene Dietrich sings \"Back Home in Indiana\" in a seedy bistro for the enjoyment of Homer Hinckley, who she feels will be the man to make her rich.\n"}
