After he finds a cryptic note in Takayama's stomach, Reiko and Y\u014dichi also turn up dead. And\u014d soon learns of a mysterious cursed videotape, haunted by the spirit of a murdered young woman. Rumor has it that anyone who watches the video will die exactly one week later. Despondent over the death of his own child, and believing that he is being guided by his rival's ghost, And\u014d decides to see the video for himself. After watching the tape, strange things begin to happen around him, and he soon discovers that the tape's restless spirit has different plans in store for him. With the help of Takayama's student, Mai Takano, And\u014d finds out more about Ry\u016bji's past as well as the mysterious young woman, Sadako Yamamura. Searching for the truth about why Ry\u016bji and Y\u014dichi died from the virus while Reiko didn\u2019t leads him to her boss Yoshino. Yoshino lets And\u014d in on a secret: he has the wife\u2019s diary. She and Ry\u016bji had been researching the cursed videotape. While Reiko had broken the curse, Ry\u016bji died a week after watching the tape. Reiko believed that creating a copy would break the curse but Y\u014dichi died a week after watching the tape, just as his father had. Yoshino shows And\u014d both the tape and the diary. When And\u014d tells Mai Takano what he\u2019s done, she is shocked and can\u2019t understand why, since she felt from the start that it was the video that killed Takayama and his family. As they are talking, Yoshino calls And\u014d. He admits that he wishes he\u2019d never been involved in Reiko\u2019s business. And\u014d believes that Yoshino had watched the video, but he denies it saying that he was too scared to. However, Yoshino still dies. And\u014d decides to destroy the videotapes and make sure that he will be the video's last victim. He then confides in Mai about his son\u2019s death, and they end up sleeping together. And\u014d asks Mai if she\u2019ll be there with him when he dies, but Mai tells him she\u2019s too scared. He understands and decides to try to find out more about the virus that killed Takayama and his son. He discovers that the virus that killed Yoshino was different from the one that killed the father and son. And\u014d asks for tests to be run on him. Meanwhile, Mai Takano goes missing and And\u014d apparently survives the curse. He starts to feel that the story was just a myth and he's relieved when Mai turns up. However, he is shocked to find out that she has been found dead, having given birth with no sign of a baby. And\u014d goes back to work and sees \u201cMai\u201d there. This woman claims to be Mai's sister but after a date and a night of intimacy, And\u014d finds out that she is none other than Sadako Yamamura, reborn and claiming to be \"perfectly dual-gendered\". He then learns that Takayama wasn\u2019t helping And\u014d stop Sadako \u2013 instead, he and his family were helping her. Yoshino, Miyashita  and many others weren\u2019t killed by a virus or the video but rather Ry\u016bji's wife\u2019s diary. In the end, And\u014d clones both Takayama and his son back to life with help from Sadako. Just as Ry\u016bji leaves, he tells And\u014d \"Many years will pass before our world will be at peace.\"\n"}
