It tells the story of the Boers\u2019 Great Trek at the end of the 30s, concluding with a reconstruction of the 1838 Battle of Blood River, where a few hundred Afrikaners defeated several thousand Zulus. Commemorating as it did their view of a highly contentious period of history, the film came to be revered by Afrikaners. It enjoyed a long after-life in South African classrooms and was shown annually on the date of the Battle of Blood River.\n"}
