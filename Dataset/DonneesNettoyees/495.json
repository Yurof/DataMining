{"wikiId": "11850569", "titre": "Kirikou and the Wild Beasts", "dateSortie": "2005", "duree": "95.0", "genre": ["Family Film", "Fantasy", "World cinema", "Animation"], "resume": "The film is a sub-story to Kirikou and the Sorceress rather than a straight sequel. The movie is set while Kirikou is still a child and Karaba is still a sorceress. Like Princes et princesses and Les Contes de la nuit, it is an anthology film comprising several episodic stories, each of them describing Kirikou's interactions with a different animals. It is however unique among Michel Ocelot's films, not only in that it is co-directed by B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Galup  but also for each of the stories being written by a different person .\n"}
