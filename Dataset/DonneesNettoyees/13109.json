A gust of wind scatters his test papers and he falls into a garbage dump trying to gather them together again. There he finds a young withered tree that caught one of his papers and he decides to take it home. He tries to plant it in his garden but gets caught by his mother who doesn\u2019t allow him to grow it. Still wanting to keep it but not being allowed to grow, Doraemon comes up with the idea of making it come alive with a gadget he uses. Nobita names the little tree \"Kib\u014d\" because all it can say is \"ki\". As the days pass, Nobita\u2019s parents also accept Kib\u014d because he was a very smart boy who helped Nobita\u2019s mother whenever he was away. However, aliens from the Planet of Green decides to pass judgement claiming humans were destroying all the green on Earth. Nobita and his friends manage to escape by coincident and arrive at their planet. They are warmly welcomed to their city of Green Pier but also learn of what they are doing to their planet. Unfortunately, with all his gadgets borrowed by Dorami, there was little Doraemon could do. They manage to escape and come across Princess Rire who tricks them into thinking she was leading them home but along the way, learns that what her adviser was about to do was wrong. Eventually with the help of the alien planet\u2019s Elder they manage to return to Earth which was already invaded. Fortunately the time watch Doraemon had dropped had frozen life on Earth giving them a chance to save everyone. The aliens try to summon their giant using Kib\u014d to wipe out all humans despite the Elder\u2019s warnings and the plan backfires on them. But with Nobita\u2019s persistence, he wakes up Kib\u014d and everything is restored as the Elder sacrifices himself. Princess Rire announces to her people that they will watch Earth for the time being while Kib\u014d decides to travel around space to learn more and become like the Elder. Nobita and his friends say goodbye to Kib\u014d and go home. Nobita's mother said to him and Doraemon for lunch, but there was Kibo's shoe beside Nobita's shoe.\n"}
