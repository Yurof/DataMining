His offer is to reunite the same men for a daring robbery in Milan, where the local offices of football betting pool Totocalcio shift the weekly revenue on Sunday afternoon via a common car with just an accountant and a driver in it. The gang would have to travel north from Rome disguised among the supporters of A.S. Roma going to Milan for a football match, commit the robbery and then flee to Bologna via a souped-up car there to rejoin the returning sport fans. The Milanese seems tough and smart and his proposal sounds very inviting for the small-time crooks who all have their problems trying to lead an \"honest\" life, but things will go differently.\n"}
