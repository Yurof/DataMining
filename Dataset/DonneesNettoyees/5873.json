Anni leaves Fritz and moves to her friend Gerda\u2019s apartment. She later takes place in a worker\u2019s sporting event where she meets Fritz again, who has recently lost his work, and they reunite. The climax of the film depicts their return home by train . Anni and Fritz as well as a handful of workers argue with middle-class and wealthy men and women over the Situation of the worldwide financial crisis. One of the workers notes that the well-off will not change the world in any case, to which one of the wealthy asks quizzically, \u201cWho else, then, can change the world?\u201d Gerda replies, \u201cThose who don\u2019t like it.\u201d The film ends with the singing of the Solidarity Song, with lyrics by Brecht and music from Hanns Eisler.\n"}
