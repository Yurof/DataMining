Brown plays hapless newspaper writer, editor; amateur pilot, HAM radio operator, and gadget crazy Elmer Lane, in 1930's rural America. In love with the beautiful Betty, he does everything he can to buy the paper outright; so, he can win her. But, somehow something always comes out of the blue: gangsters, smugglers, murdered mobsters, rival newspaper reporters, con artists, police, new inventions, and small dogs, all get in the way. It's all \"Riding on Air\" how this fun, wild, ride, will land, or if the parachute will even open.\n"}
