The mostly middle-aged, middle-class students attend the class for a variety of reasons, but for the most part they enjoy the sensual romanticism of the tango's dance movements and music. When Vincente's handsome nephew shows up from the countryside, passions grow more heated, and closeted jealousies and rivalries of the students become unscaled. At the film's end, the leader Carla reveals a surprising fact about herself.\n"}
