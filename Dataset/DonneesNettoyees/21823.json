{"wikiId": "27517359", "titre": "Yariyan", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "", "genre": ["Family Film"], "resume": "A story about three friends and the twists and turns that life throws at them. Rida, Jahan and Babar are the best of friends. The fact that they come from three completely different backgrounds only serves to bring them closer together and complement each other in every aspect of life. Jahan is a wealthy young man who loves to party and live life to the fullest. His biggest weakness in life is the fact that he has a soft spot for the ladies and always likes to have a new girl by his side. However, although Jahan may seem all bright and bubbly on the surface, he does have a cross to bear. Jahan\u2019s parents\u2019 split up when he was young, and he now lives with his father and step mother. His relationship with them is far from perfect, as his father is hardly ever at home, while he can\u2019t stand his step mother. This leaves Jahan feeling unwanted and looking to his friends for support, his closest ally being Babar. Babar is a hardworking guy who has his feet firmly on the ground. After having been scarred for life during his childhood, because his mother left his father due to financial issues, Babar has deep psychological problems. For him, his friends are his only family and people he can rely on through thick and thin. Rida meanwhile is a self\u2013made young girl who has worked her way through college with a lot of dignity and self-respect. For Rida, life is all about living from the heart, and taking decisions on impulse rather than thinking them through logically. A trait her friends sometimes find it very hard to deal with. \u2018Yariyan\u2019 is the story of how Jahan, Rida and Babar\u2019s friendship is tested as they go through life. Whether it\u2019s Rida\u2019s decision to marry an HIV patient; Jahan\u2019s decision to let Babar look after his newly inherited family business; or the love of Babar\u2019s life, who soon catches Jahan\u2019s eye and becomes the reason he reforms himself; life\u2019s twists and turns make all three friends question their friendship more than once. A story full of lies, deceit, conspiracy, intrigue and how they all, at some point, come in the way of a deep and beautiful friendship.\n"}
