A letter from the exiled Napoleon is given to the ship's captain to deliver to a man in Marseille. Before he dies of a sickness, the captain entrusts the task to his first officer, Edmond Dant\u00e8s . However, the city magistrate, Raymond de Villefort, Jr. , is tipped off by an informer, the second officer, Danglars , and has both men arrested after the exchange. Dant\u00e8s' friend Fernand Mondego  accompanies him to the jail. However, he, Danglars, and de Villefort all stand to gain from keeping Dant\u00e8s imprisoned: Mondego is in love with Dant\u00e8s' fianc\u00e9e, Mercedes ; Danglars wants to be promoted captain in Dant\u00e8s' place; and the man who accepted the letter turns out to be de Villefort's father . De Villefort consigns Dant\u00e8s without trial to a notorious prison, the Ch\u00e2teau d'If, on the false testimony of Danglars. When Napoleon returns to France, giving Dant\u00e8s' friends hope for his release, de Villefort signs a false statement that he was killed trying to escape, which Mondego shows to Mercedes. Deceived, she gives in to her mother's deathbed wish and marries Mondego. Eight years of solitary confinement follow for Dant\u00e8s. Then one day, the aged Abb\u00e9 Faria , a fellow prisoner, breaks into his cell through a tunnel he has been digging. The two join forces; Faria calculates it will take five more years to finish. In the meantime, he starts educating Dant\u00e8s. However, as they near their goal, a cave-in fatally injures the old man. Before he dies, he bequeaths a vast hidden treasure to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 . The body is sewn into a shroud, but while the undertaker is away, Dant\u00e8s substitutes himself for the corpse undetected. He is cast into the sea. He frees himself and is picked up by a smuggling ship. Dant\u00e8s later follows the abb\u00e9's directions and finds the treasure on the uninhabited island of Monte Cristo. With a fortune at his command, he sets in motion his plans for revenge. To begin, he arranges to have Albert , Mercedes and Mondego's son, kidnapped and held for ransom. Dant\u00e8s \"rescues\" the younger man in order to gain entry into Paris society, using his purchased title of Count of Monte Cristo. First to be brought to justice is Mondego. While the French ambassador to Albania, Mondego gained renown for his bravery in an unsuccessful defense of Ali Pasha. Dant\u00e8s arranges a ball to \"honor\" his enemy, then arranges to have him exposed publicly as the one who betrayed Ali Pasha to his death at the hands of the Turks. Unaware of the count's role in his disgrace, Mondego goes to him for advice. Dant\u00e8s reveals his identity and they engage in a duel; Dant\u00e8s wins, but spares Mondego, who returns home and commits suicide. Next is Danglars, now the most influential banker in Paris. Dant\u00e8s uses his services to buy and sell shares, sharing tips he receives from his informants. When these turn out to be infallibly profitable, Danglars bribes a man to send him copies of messages to Dant\u00e8s. Greed leads him to invest all of his money on the next report, just as Dant\u00e8s had planned. When the tip proves to be false, Danglers is bankrupted. Dant\u00e8s reveals his true identity to Danglers, who is left penniless and insane. However, there are unexpected complications that threaten Dant\u00e8s' carefully conceived plans. Albert Mondego learns of his involvement in his father's downfall and challenges him to a duel. Mercedes, who had recognized her former lover upon their first meeting, begs him not to kill her son. He agrees. Fortunately, Albert deliberately changes his aim because his mother has told him who Monte Cristo really is, and the duel ends without injury. De Villefort has risen to the high office of State Attorney. Dant\u00e8s sends him information about his true identity and activities, which leads to his arrest and trial. At first, Dant\u00e8s refuses to testify, in order to shield de Villefort's daughter Valentine , who is in love with Albert. However, when she learns of it, she urges him to defend himself. Dant\u00e8s does so, providing evidence of de Villefort's longstanding corruption. At last, with all of his enemies destroyed, Dant\u00e8s is reunited with Mercedes.\n"}
