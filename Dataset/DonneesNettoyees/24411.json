She ends up living in a grubby bedsit before finding a job at a fashionable boutique , and taking a spare room in a flat owned by one of her co-workers, Caroline specifically as she hopes to meet a man at one of Caroline\u2019s many parties. Peter, appears to live with an older, alcoholic woman. He invites her upstairs. She goes into his room and, unseen, starts screaming. After discovering Caroline in bed with another co-worker that she was interested in , Brenda runs crying out of the flat and onto the streets. She comes across a scruffy dog, and sees its owner looking for it. Recognising the young man who had previously bumped into her , she picks up the dog and runs home with it. Unbeknownst to her, Peter sees her do so. Back at the flat, Brenda washes the dog, and pretties it up with a bow. She then uses the address on the dog\u2019s collar to take it back to Peter. He lets her in, and is nice to her, but upsets her when he insists she tell him why she took the dog. She finally admits that it was because she wanted to meet him, and have a baby with him. He suggests that she moves in with him. While she has gone to get her belongings, Peter kills his dog with a utility knife, ostensibly because it is now pretty.
