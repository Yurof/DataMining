He encounters Kaori, a female expert with knives. And there's Hyouei, an illegitimate son of Yagy\u016b Retsudo who kills anyone Itt\u014d and Daigoro come into contact with. It culminates in a final battle between Itt\u014d and the combined clan groups under Retsudo on a snow-capped mountain in northern Japan, in which the baby cart becomes a sled. Itt\u014d defeats the entire army, shooting, stabbing, slashing, dismembering, and beheading the entire army. But the one-eyed Retsudo again gets away, vowing to kill Itt\u014d another time.\n"}
