The film then reverts to their wedding day, before ending with scenes at the Italian beach resort where, already acquaintances from work, they ran into each other by chance and first began their relationship. Ozon has also said that the backward structure of the story was in part inspired by Jane Campion\u2019s 1986 film Two Friends, and that it allowed for \u201ca true, lucid reading of a couple\u2019s story\u201d.\n"}
