{"wikiId": "2729561", "titre": "Carson City", "dateSortie": "1952", "duree": "87.0", "genre": ["Western"], "resume": "Mine owner William Sharon  keeps having his gold shipments held up by a gang of bandits. Sharon hires banker Charles Crocker , who happens to have connections in the Central Pacific Railroad, to build a spur line from Virginia City to Carson City, so that the gold can be shipped by rail. Silent Jeff Kincaid  is the railroad engineer. However, there is opposition to the railroad, chiefly from another mine owner, Big Jack Davis . He doesn\u2019t own a working mine; he finds it easier to rob from the other owners. Davis is the brains behind the gang holding up Sharon\u2019s shipments. The technique is to hold up the stagecoach and then provide food and champagne for the passengers, who then don\u2019t care that the gold is robbed. Kincaid vows to rid Carson City of the bandits, but they frame him on a murder charge. In the climax, Kincaid has to contend with a suspicious landslide which kills some of his workers, trapping others, and a gold bullion heist.\n"}
