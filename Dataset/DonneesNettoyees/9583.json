His agent informs him that Capitol Pictures in Hollywood has offered a thousand dollars per week to write movie scripts. Barton hesitates, worried that moving to California would separate him from \"the common man\", his focus as a writer. He accepts the offer, however, and checks into the Hotel Earle, a large and unusually deserted building. His room is sparse and draped in subdued colors; its only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach, arm raised to block the sun. In his first meeting with Capitol Pictures boss Jack Lipnick (thumb|upright|left|The Coen brothers wrote the role of Charlie Meadows for actor John Goodman, in part because of the \"warm and friendly image that he projects for the viewer\".Coen and Coen, p. 129. then informs him that he is to remain in Los Angeles, and that&nbsp;\u2013 although he will remain under contract&nbsp;\u2013 Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes so he can be ridiculed as a loser around the studio while Lipnick is in the war.
