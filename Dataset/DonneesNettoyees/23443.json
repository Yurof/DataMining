Faraway hands Quackie an attach\u00e9 case that must be delivered to the Slobovian consulate in West Slobovia\u2014however, he warns Quackie that \"every spy in the country\" will attempt to steal it! Immediately upon taking custody of the attach\u00e9 case, Quackie loses it to a mysterious man wearing a green hat, whereupon Quackie, Mary and the inspector give chase. Quackie follows the thief to a railway depot, where they board the Cloak & Dagger Express. Quackie tries in various ways to prove that the man wears a green hat and thus is the man he's after. The two take tea together, the thief speaking in a Slavic accent, after which the chase resumes. With some help from Faraway and Mary, Quackie eventually prevails, and delivers the attach\u00e9 case to the consulate. Quackie is dismayed, however, when the consul  produces from the case what appears to be a simple, brown instant-coffee jar, whose label reads: Instructions\u2014Add Water and Pour. Quackie is incredulous, demanding, \"You mean, all that hassle just so you could have a coffee break?\" The consul pours water into the jar, shakes it, and out pops a beautiful woman in an evening gown and fur wrap\u2014it seems the consul needed a date for the embassy ball! Quackie then notices a label on the other side of the jar, which reads: \"Acme House Instant Girl.\" Bemusedly, Quackie remarks: \"You know, there just might be a market for this!\"\n"}
