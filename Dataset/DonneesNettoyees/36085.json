He and his best friend Camel often fantastize about their female classmates and their mothers, but have less luck with girls in reality. Herv\u00e9 unsuccessfully pursues romances with various girls at his school, including with Laura, who accepts his offer of a date as a joke. After Aurore, a beautiful, popular girl at school, asks him on a date, they embark on an awkward relationship. Although Herv\u00e9 and Camel are frequent masturbators, while both alone and together, Herv\u00e9 and Aurore are slow to engage in sexual activity beyond kissing. Aurore eventually breaks up with Herv\u00e9 when his friends try to grope her in a game of Dungeons & Dragons and she discovers that he lied to them about having sex with her. The film concludes with the characters in high school; Herv\u00e9 is dating Sabrina, Camel is dating Jenifer, Aurore is dating Wulfran, and Herv\u00e9's mother is married to Anas's father.\n"}
