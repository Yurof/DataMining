Ang\u00e9lique is a successful art student who has won a scholarship. In between creating her art projects, she has a part-time job at a cafe and house sits for a wealthy vacationing family. Ang\u00e9lique's friend David  disapproves of Ang\u00e9lique's affair with Lo\u00efc, who is married, but Ang\u00e9lique insists that Lo\u00efc will leave his wife for her. When Lo\u00efc's wife, Rachel , has a miscarriage, the pair separate and Ang\u00e9lique prepares to leave with Lo\u00efc on a romantic getaway to Florence, Italy. However, Lo\u00efc doesn't meet Ang\u00e9lique at the airport, having chosen to mend things with his wife. This is the last straw for Ang\u00e9lique, who is thrown into a self-destructive cycle of clinical depression, ultimately losing her job and scholarship. While watching the news one night, she learns that Lo\u00efc has been arrested for assaulting one of his patients, Sonia Jasmin . She goes to Sonia's house to convince her to drop the charges. The conversation turns into a scuffle and Sonia, who has a heart condition, has a heart attack and dies. Ang\u00e9lique steals from the house to make it look like a robbery. Thinking that this will win him back, Ang\u00e9lique goes to see Lo\u00efc at his office, arriving just in time to see him being arrested for Sonia Jasmin's murder, and embracing his wife as he is dragged away. Ang\u00e9lique returns home, turns on the gas and lies down on the floor. At this point the film rewinds to the opening scene when Ang\u00e9lique bought the pink rose. This time the film follows the delivery boy and the subsequent events play out from the viewpoint of Lo\u00efc. Lo\u00efc receives the pink rose and assumes that his wife sent it to him. It is revealed that Lo\u00efc barely knows Ang\u00e9lique, and they cross paths only incidentally due to the fact that Ang\u00e9lique is house sitting the home that belongs to Lo\u00efc and Rachel's neighbor. However, Lo\u00efc receives Ang\u00e9lique's gifts and messages, not knowing who sent them. It is revealed that Rachel's miscarriage was caused by \"someone\" running her down with a moped; earlier in the film, Ang\u00e9lique is shown after an \"accident\" which ruined her friend's moped and injured her arm. Lo\u00efc comes to believe that his stalker is Sonia Jasmin, one of his patients. He physically attacks Sonia, demanding she reveal that she is his stalker. Sonia presses charges for assault, then dies of a heart attack. Lo\u00efc is arrested as the prime suspect for her \"murder\". At his arrest, Rachel tells the police that he was with her on the night of the death, which clears him of all charges. That night, Lo\u00efc hears police sirens and sees an ambulance pull up to his neighbor's house where Ang\u00e9lique has just tried to commit suicide. As a doctor, Lo\u00efc performs mouth to mouth resuscitation which causes Ang\u00e9lique to regain consciousness. Now aware of Ang\u00e9lique, he considers the possibility that she is his stalker. Lo\u00efc explores the house that Ang\u00e9lique was house-sitting, and there he finds a life-sized garbage mosaic of himself. After being released from the hospital, Ang\u00e9lique visits Lo\u00efc at his clinic. Lo\u00efc tells her that they never had nor will ever have a relationship. As he turns his back on her, Ang\u00e9lique strikes him over the head with a brass figurine. She is then arrested, diagnosed with erotomania and remanded to a mental institution. Rachel stands by her husband as he recovers from his injuries, with a scene showing the couple in a house filled with their children as Lo\u00efc hobbles around on a cane. The epilogue of the film is set five years later, when Ang\u00e9lique is released from the mental institution. Her therapist praises her progress and tells her, \"If you keep taking your medication, you will be fine.\" However, when the cleaning man is clearing Ang\u00e9lique's room, he discovers her pills have been glued to the wall behind the wardrobe in a mosaic of Lo\u00efc.\n"}
