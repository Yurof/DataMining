Her life will take such strange turns you\u2019ll think she\u2019s following a script. But really, we\u2019re watching a real life protagonist evolve in the face of life. For, ultimately, nothing is ever as surprising as life. Except, perhaps, fiction! During 'sessions' with the mysterious, masked HEROLD, her life unfolds before our eyes and we will learn about everything: Istanbul, Germany, family, friends, drugs and death. \u201cShould I Really Do It?\u201d plays with these concepts of real life and fiction, documentary and drama... Could life ever be more interesting than fiction?\n"}
