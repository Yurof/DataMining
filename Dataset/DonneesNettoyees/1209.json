{"wikiId": "12278759", "titre": "The Burnt Theatre", "dateSortie": "2005", "duree": "85.0", "genre": ["Documentary", "War film"], "resume": "While much of Cambodia's cultural heritage was eradicated through the deaths of many artists during the Khmer Rouge era, the country's main theatrical structure, Preah Suramarit National Theatre remained standing throughout the Cambodian Civil War, even occasionally being used by the communist regime for official visits and propaganda pageants. Ironically, it was while the theatre was undergoing repairs in 1994 that it caught fire, was heavily damaged and has never been restored. Also interviewed is actress Peng Phan , who is racked with Survivor guilt and is overcome by psychosomatic illness. The reporter's questioning and the activities of the performers are intercut with scenes of men and women sifting through refuse at a garbage dump. At another point, the members of the theatre troupe forage for food in the theatre itself, harvesting bats from the ceiling of the theatre halls and frying the winged mammals in a wok.\n"}
