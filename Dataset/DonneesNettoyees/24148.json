These are the regulars of Ankara\u2019s 25 year-old bar, Black & White, who gather here every evening. And then there is the bar\u2019s manager Faruk, a stubborn, grumpy, touchy but extremely sweet man. One day, Faruk announces that he can no longer go on running the bar, and wants to shut it down. The regulars try their best to dissuade him.\n"}
