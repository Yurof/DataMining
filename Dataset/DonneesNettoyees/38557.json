Their arrival is greeted with enthusiasm by young farm boy Tas, and weeks of exploration and good times follow before Aunt Jandie enters hospital, leaving the children in the care of Ma and Pa Pinner, her foreman and housekeeper. A few days of tyrannical treatment by the Pinners force the children to seek refuge in a secret cave, where they set up home to await the return of Jandie. Despite Pa\u2019s repeated efforts to recapture them, it is here the children stay until Nigel\u2019s secret trip to town uncovers a plot by the Pinners to abandon the farm and swindle Aunt Jandie.\n"}
