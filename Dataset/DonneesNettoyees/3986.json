After the body is recovered, Dr. G\u00e9nessier  identifies the remains as those of his missing daughter, Christiane G\u00e9nessier , whose face was horribly disfigured in an automobile accident that occurred before her disappearance. Dr. G\u00e9nessier lives in a large mansion, which is adjacent to his clinic, with numerous caged German Shepherds  and other large dogs. Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. G\u00e9nessier and his assistant Louise, the woman who had disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden. The body belonged to a young woman that died following Dr. G\u00e9nessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. G\u00e9nessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiance Jacques Vernon , who works with Dr. G\u00e9nessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.  Louise lures a young female student named Edna Gr\u00fcber  to G\u00e9nessier's home, by promising her accommodation from friends of hers. G\u00e9nessier chloroforms Edna and takes her to his secret laboratory, where he performs heterograft surgery, removing her face. The doctor successfully grafts the skin onto his daughter's face and holds the heavily bandaged and faceless Edna against her will. Edna escapes, but falls to her death from an upstairs window. After disposing of Edna's corpse, G\u00e9nessier notices flaws on Christiane's face. Her face grows worse within days; the new tissue is being rejected and she must resort to wearing her mask again. Christiane again phones Jacques and this time says his name, but the phone call is interrupted by Louise. Jacques reports the call to the police, who have been investigating the disappearance of several young women with blue eyes and similar facial characteristics. The police have gained a lead concerning a woman who wears a pearl choker, whom Jacques recognizes as Louise. Inspector Parot , an officer investigating Edna's disappearance, asks a young woman named Paulette M\u00e9rodon  to help investigate by checking herself into G\u00e9nessier's clinic. After being declared healthy, Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise, who delivers her to Dr. G\u00e9nessier. G\u00e9nessier is about to begin surgery on Paulette when Louise informs him that the police want to see him. While the doctor talks with the police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. G\u00e9nessier dismisses the police and returns to his lab, where the dogs attack him, brutally disfiguring his face. Christiane walks slowly into the woods outside G\u00e9nessier's house with one of the freed doves on her hand.\n"}
