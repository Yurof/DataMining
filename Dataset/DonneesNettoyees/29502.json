Turner is bored with little police work in the fictional town of Cypress Beach, California and is set to transfer to a better job in Sacramento while fellow investigator David Sutton  is to be his replacement. Turner pleads with police chief Howard Hyde  to let him take on Amos' murder case. Believing that Hooch is the only \"witness\" he has, Turner brings him home. The energetic dog promptly destroys Turner's house, his car, and turns his life upside-down. On a positive note, however, Hooch also instigates a romance between Turner and the new town veterinarian Emily Carson .\n"}
