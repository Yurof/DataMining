{"wikiId": "18586060", "titre": "Ice People", "dateSortie": "2008", "duree": "77.0", "genre": ["World cinema", "Documentary"], "resume": "Ice People brings Anne Aghion and her crew to Antarctica where they spent four months following the lives of North Dakota State University geologist professors Allan Ashworth and Adam Lewis, as well as the McMurdo Station staff over four months. The film crew then followed the professors and two undergraduate students into the field where they camped out and shot in conditions of extreme cold and winds that ranged from -50\u00b0C/-60\u00b0F to 0\u00b0C/32\u00b0F. The film shows the scientific team scouring ancient emptied lakebeds in the hope of finding evidence of plants and insects that would prove that the world's coldest continent was once warm and verdant roughly 14 to 20 million years ago.\n"}
