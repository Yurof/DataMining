Gus likes to tell half-true stories about all the girls he\u2019s slept with and all the drugs he\u2019s done. Jessica is seventeen too. She doesn't seem to have much in common with anyone anymore \u2013 not even her best friend Christie. Every year this one guy Brian throws a 4th of July party. The party\u2019s never that great, but there's free beer, so people always go. Gus and Jessica meet each other there. They watch fireworks outside and light sparklers. Gus says that he's not the sort of guy she thinks he is. He tells her a secret he has never told anyone before.\n"}
