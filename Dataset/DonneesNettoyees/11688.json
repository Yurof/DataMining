{"wikiId": "9408711", "titre": "The Minder", "dateSortie": "2006", "duree": "95.0", "genre": ["Drama", "Indie"], "resume": "Rub\u00e9n  is excellent in his job, but in the midst of an existentialist crisis, he begins to suffer from the emptiness of his life - having sworn to protect Artemio , a man who barely acknowledges his presence or merit; a man with whom, in fact, has little dialogue or contact throughout the movie, even when they share the screen most of the time. Rub\u00e9n has little to no private life as well: his sister is a wreck, her daughter, spoiled; he visits prostitutes in his spare time and is unappreciated by those who surround him at work. His only real relationship is Artemio's driver, Salinas , whose simplicity does not suffice Rub\u00e9n. Eventually, Rub\u00e9n snaps: tired of his boss' infidelity to his wife, his downright hypocrisy and disdainful manner towards him, he frequents an illegal arms dealer, purchasing a gun with a silencer. When his boss suffers a heart attack, Rub\u00e9n is left to take care of him, and soon he shoots Artemio offhand - the one person who is supposed to protect him from a threat that remains invisible in the film. He then runs away to Mar del Plata, where the last scene has Rub\u00e9n contemplating the sea he never swam .\n"}
