{"wikiId": "370227", "titre": "Young T\u00f6rless", "dateSortie": "1966", "duree": "87.0", "genre": ["Thriller", "World cinema", "Black-and-white", "Period piece", "Drama", "Film adaptation"], "resume": "The story is set at the beginning of the 20th century. When Thomas T\u00f6rless  arrives at the academy, he learns how Anselm von Basini  has been caught stealing by fellow student Reiting , and is obliged to become Reiting's \"slave,\" bowing to Reiting's sadistic rituals. T\u00f6rless follows their relationship with intellectual interest but without emotional involvement. Also partaking in these sessions is Beineberg , with whom T\u00f6rless visits Bozena , the local prostitute. Again, T\u00f6rless is aloof and more intrigued than excited by the woman. He is however very eager to understand imaginary numbers, which are mentioned in his maths lesson. The maths teacher is unwilling or unable to explain what these are, stating that in life, emotion is what rules everything - even mathematics. After Basini is nearly lynched by a mob because of one of Reiting's intrigues, T\u00f6rless realises intellectually that the other boys are simply cruel. He seems no more or less emotionally moved by this than by the revelation that he cannot understand imaginary numbers. He decides that he does not want to partake in cruelty, so decides to leave the academy. His teachers think that he is too \"highly strung\" for his own good, and do not want him to stay anyway - they are part of the system which can allow such terrible things to be done to the weak and vulnerable. At the end of the film T\u00f6rless gets his mother to take him away from the school. He drives away, laughing.\n"}
