The conflicts of this country condemns To\u00f1o  and Paulina , the protagonists, to the exile, but they live another drama that torments them. The suffering, the disappointment, the loving disappointment nests in their interior. Each of them feels lonely, incapable of assuming the pain of the other, and much less to see themselves as part of a couple. Their passion could open the door than no one will, but To\u00f1o and Paulina find in love the force that repels them and that does not help them survive.\n"}
