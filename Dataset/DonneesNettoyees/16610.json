Stewart struggles to provide for his sickly girlfriend, Kathy, whose medicine cost more than he can afford \u2013 that is until he starts running narcotics across the county line for a man named Dutch. Meanwhile, Travis\u2019 grandfather educates his grandson about generations of family feuds and encourages him to enact revenge. Their stories become linked and descend into barbarity when Stewart begins to investigate the nauseatingly violent murders of mountain-folk in the area. Both Stewart and Travis blindly follow the motivating force of love, justifying their actions along the way, until they\u2019re led down colliding paths of death and self-destruction.\n"}
