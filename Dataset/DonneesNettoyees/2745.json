Fant\u00f4mas is also planning to abduct a second scientist, professor Lefebvre. Journalist Fandor develops an ingenious scheme whereby he disguises himself as Lefebvre and attends a scientific conference in Rome, Italy to lure Fant\u00f4mas into attempting to kidnap him. The plan seems to work until commissaire Juve steps into the fray and as usual messes things up, although Juve redeems himself by saving the troupe with an array of special gadgets which he has developed especially for his hunt for Fant\u00f4mas. Yet, once again Fant\u00f4mas escapes in style, using his Citro\u00ebn DS with retractable wings that converts into an airplane in what amounts to one of the most unexpected and spectacular scenes of the genre.Picture of the Fant\u00f4mas Citro\u00ebn DS with retractable wings through Internet Archive\n"}
