While there, he reunites with his true love, Angela Delton , a Miami news reporter who has also returned home for her brother's funeral. Bo also meets their 16-year-old daughter, Dixie Leigh Delton , for the first time. Since Bo walked away from Angela while she was still pregnant, Dixie has never met him or his side of the family.
