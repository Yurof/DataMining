His guides are a cranky, anti-semitic grandfather ; his deranged Border collie named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.; and his over-enthusiastic grandson, Alex , whose fractured command of English, passion for American pop culture, and constant chatter threaten to make the worst of every situation. But what starts out as the tour from hell turns into a meaningful journey, with an unexpected series of revelations that will change all of their lives.Overview and Movie Review New York Times.\n"}
