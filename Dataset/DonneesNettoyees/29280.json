It is shown as an extension of the government, not respecting the law, and putting political service above its responsibilities of the crisis. Sabina Guzzanti caricatures Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and is critical of the government, especially Berlusconi and Guido Bertolaso, the chief of the Protezione Civile. She presents the Italian opposition as invisible and ineffective.\n"}
