After four years, with bank officers preparing to foreclose on the brewery, he retreats to his Saratoga summer home, only to find four dead mobsters who meant to ambush him, but were killed by their confederate whom they meant to betray. More and more problems begin to pop up in the life of the former bootlegger, as he's taken in a bratty orphan, and his daughter comes home with a fianc\u00e9 that turns out to be a state cop.\n"}
