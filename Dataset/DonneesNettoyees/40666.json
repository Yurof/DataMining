It shows the loss of utopia and the struggle of ideologies in Cuba: Ricardo Mart\u00ednez is a former rebel of Fidel Castro. Together with Che Guevara he has founded the Pirate radio Radio Rebelde that became the main revolutionary voice of Cuba. The younger Cuban generation listens to Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed that broadcasts from Miami, Florida. Miriam represents this younger generation. By comparing this to radio stations, the film is as well about media history.\n"}
