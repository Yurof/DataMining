The store also serves as the town's post office, where Alice is working as post-mistress. She is in love with the local doctor's son Kenneth. They\u2019d marry; but, her Aunt\u2019s feud with Doc, puts all kinds of stumbling blocks, in their way. Kenneth is working as a doctor in the next town; but, doesn\u2019t make enough to support a wife and their younger brother; so, they have to wait. When the town drunk is made Deputy Sherriff, after the death of his daughter, it seems like tragedy, may turn to comedy; and, maybe, a happy ending, after all.\n"}
