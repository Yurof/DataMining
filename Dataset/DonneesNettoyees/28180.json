Visiting novelist J. Hugh Ramsey  considers himself both too wise to ever marry and, through hubris, qualified to offer his own wild theories on what constitutes a happy marriage. He had thus written a best selling novel titled Marriage, the Living Death. Ramsey decides that the Bigelow marriage could not possibly be as perfect as it appears, and convinces Homer that his wife must be secretly unhappy because she had never had the opportunity to forgive the morally spotless Homer for any misdeed. Wishing to please, Homer decides to involve himself in a trist so that Marcia would then have something for which she could forgive him. He chooses French actress Ren\u00e9e La Journ\u00e9e  who is performing nearby. Ramsey learns of the affair and discovers that the La Journ\u00e9e turns out to be the one love of his life that he had lost years earlier.\n"}
