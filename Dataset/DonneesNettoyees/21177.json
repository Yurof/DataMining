They find an old but cheap mansion in the country that has been vacant for 40 years, Bellingham House, and proceed to buy it. They move in along with their servants and soon learn the house is supposedly haunted \u2013 but Mr Smedhurst in particular is sceptical of the paranormal myth. They invite a young companion, Annette , to join them but within days of arriving she steadily begins hearing strange voices. The new owners learn that a young invalid girl was believed to have been murdered 40 years previously in the house \u2013 and their preconceptions of the supernatural are challenged. When the spirit of the murdered girl possesses Annette, her health declines drastically and soon she\u2019s at death's door. A young doctor, Dr Selbie , has fallen deeply in love with Annette and attempts to cure her but to no avail. In a state of delirium, Annette calls for old Dr Marsham , the GP who had attended to the dead girl 40 years earlier.\n"}
