Isaku's paintings have an S&M theme which surprises Kanako. Tomoe persuades Kanako to begin going with her to a class in which she is learning how to behave like a proper female dog. Kanako's husband, Eiichir\u014d, is suspicious about her activities. After hiring a private detective and learning about her perverse hobbies, Eiichir\u014d throws Kanako into a landfill. The film ends with Eiichir\u014d apparently taking his dog for a walk. The camera pans down to show that, despite his apparent objections to her lessons, Eiichir\u014d is in fact walking Kanako, who is on all fours on a dog leash.\n"}
