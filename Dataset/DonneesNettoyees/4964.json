They have two children: Ramir\u00edn and \u00c1ngela. One winter day, Luisa, stopping in a traffic light, spots her ex-husband, \u00c1ngel, who is selling tissues on the streets. After that brief encounter, the next day, Luisa looks for \u00c1ngel in the area where she saw him before. She finds him wandering about the city in destitution. Overcome with sentimentality and, over Ramiro's objections, Luisa takes \u00c1ngel into her home in an effort to help him and rebuild the friendship the three of them once had. Luisa is convinced that destiny has reunited them. Luisa, \u00c1ngel and Ramiro were three inseparable friends in their childhood and youth. Once they became adults, they formed an uneasy love triangle in which the two men were rivals for Luisa's affection. Luisa married \u00c1ngel, but two years later, she left him to marry Ramiro, who she thought was the one she was mean to be with. Ramiro is not pleased to see again his former friend who by now he wishfully presumed to be dead. Unwillingly, he accepts \u00c1ngel's presence. He thought \u00c1ngel was working in construction living a prosperous life in South America. However, after his divorce from Luisa's, \u00c1ngel spent all his money in a restless life. He reappears after more than ten years of absence, broke and ill. \u00c1ngel still loves Luisa and has never overcome his feelings of resentment about their divorce. He still wears the ring she gave him in their first and only wedding anniversary. The ring has the inscription: P.R.E.O.M. that stands for: To be reunited in the other world . Initially overwhelmed by Luisa's mystical and deranged streak, \u00c1ngel tries to leave but \u00c1ngela brings him back home. He has fits, foaming, and blood in the mouth. Medical results show that he is terminally ill. Soon, Ramiro and \u00c1ngel shift from friends to enemies and have a bitter confrontation. Luisa is torn between them. She loves \u00c1ngel as a part of herself, but also loves her husband and beyond reason, wants to have them both. \u00c1ngel establishes a friendship with the couple's little children, Ramirin and \u00c1ngela. The girl is more sympathetic and the boy, always taking his father side, is a little hostile. \u00c1ngel spellbinds them both with his offbeat stories and his directness. He takes them to a short trip to the beach where he reenacts with them a scene from his own childhood. He sees in the children the reflection of his own youth and his erstwhile friendship with Luisa and Ramiro. While \u00c1ngel is at the beach, Ramiro and Luisa find out that \u00c1ngel is terminally ill and has very little time to live. Ramiro hopes he can wait out \u00c1ngel's declining health, while Luisa does not accept the medical verdict. As \u00c1ngel's health worsens, Luisa insists upon caring for him in the house rather than sending him off to a hospital. He is soon bedridden and in constant pain. Luisa makes love to him, and when she returns to Ramiro in their bedroom, she has sex with her husband. She loves them both intensely and equally. When \u00c1ngel condition worsens, he falls in to coma, Luisa, alone through force of will brings him back to life to the astonishment of her husband and children. She takes \u00c1ngel to bed, and in spite of his illness makes love to him. She does not deceive her husband, she tells him so right after. Ramiro takes the information with resignation knowing that the end is near for his rival. When \u00c1ngel is at death's door, Ramiro prepares a lethal doze of anesthetic to accelerate his death. In the final moment, the dying man makes a final, desperate bid to steal his ex-wife away from her new spouse. He grasps the hypodermic needle with its overdose of anesthetic and kills Ramiro. Dragging himself to his rival's marital bed, \u00c1ngel dies next to Luisa. Luisa then takes a ring with P.R.E.O.M. written on the inside from her dresser and puts it on the now dead Ramiro, to bring the two ex-friends and rivals together in the after life.
