The flash backs then show how he blackmailed his fellow senior classmates of Clover High School into contributing to a literary magazine he's publishing. Sheryl Phillips is also searching for a way to reconnect with her son as he prepares to head off to college. Colfer said the movie \"is about all the kids in high school who are overachieving in their own right and underappreciated for it just like I was. I think it\u2019s very sarcastic and very real. I hope it goes to show that there are still lots and lots of smart kids out in the world. It\u2019s about smart kids and not about stupid kids who wanna get laid and that\u2019s their biggest goal in life.\"\"Allison Janney joins Chris Colfer comedy 'Struck by Lightning'\", Entertainment Weekly, June 29, 2011, Retrieved September 26, 2011.\n"}
