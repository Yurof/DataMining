Her sexual life is restricted to elaborate fantasies involving domination, sadomasochism, and bondage. Although frustrated by his wife's frigidity toward him, he respects her wishes. While visiting a ski resort, they meet two friends, Henri Husson  and Ren\u00e9e . S\u00e9verine does not like Husson's manner and the way he looks at her. Back in Paris, S\u00e9verine meets up with Ren\u00e9e and learns that a mutual friend, Henrietta, now works at a brothel. At her home, S\u00e9verine receives roses from Husson and is unsettled by the gesture. At the tennis courts, she meets Husson and they discuss Henrietta and houses of pleasure. Husson mentions a high-class brothel to S\u00e9verine at 11 Cite Jean de Saumer. He also confesses his desire for her, but S\u00e9verine rejects his advances. Haunted by childhood memories involving her father, S\u00e9verine goes to the high-class brothel, which is run by Madame Ana\u00efs . That afternoon S\u00e9verine services her first client. Reluctant at first, she responds to the \"firm hand\" of Madame Ana\u00efs, who names her 'Belle de Jour', and has sex with the stranger. After staying away for a week, S\u00e9verine returns to the brothel and begins working from two to five o'clock each day, returning to her unsuspecting husband in the evenings. One day Husson comes to visit her at home, but S\u00e9verine refuses to see him. Still she fantasizes about having sex with him in her husband's presence. Ironically, S\u00e9verine's physical relationship with her husband is improving and she begins sleeping with him. S\u00e9verine becomes involved with a young gangster, Marcel , who offers her the kind of thrills and excitement of her fantasies. When Marcel becomes increasingly jealous and demanding, S\u00e9verine decides to leave the brothel, with Madame Ana\u00efs' agreement. S\u00e9verine is also concerned about Husson who knows about her secret life at the brothel. One of Marcel's gangster associates follows S\u00e9verine to her home, and soon Marcel visits her and threatens to reveal her secret life to her husband. S\u00e9verine pleads with him to leave her home, and after some time he does. Marcel waits downstairs for Pierre to return home and shoots him three times before escaping. He is eventually tracked down and shot dead by the police. S\u00e9verine's husband survives, but is left in a coma. The police are unable to find a motive for the attempted murder. Sometime later S\u00e9verine is at home taking care of Pierre who is now completely paralyzed and in a wheelchair. Husson visits him and tells Pierre the truth about his wife's secret life; she does not try to stop him. Afterwards, S\u00e9verine dreams that her husband is healthy again and they are happy.\n"}
