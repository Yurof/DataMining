Unfortunately, their gig is cancelled once they arrive, leaving them stranded. Feeling bad for them, attractive se\u00f1orita Greta  gets the boys a gig at the local bull ring. Joe is so ecstatic that he plants a kiss right on Greta's cheek, much to the chagrin of her jealous husband Jos\u00e9 . In an act of revenge, Jos\u00e9 pays the bullring attendant  to release a live bull into the ring. Moe and Larry flee the ring, but Joe is unaware of the switch. He eventually head-butts the wild animal, and is paraded out of the ring to the rousing cheers of \"Ol\u00e9, Americano!\"\n"}
