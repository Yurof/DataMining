She quickly finds herself being terrorized by all the myths and urban legends that have become part of Chippewa Lake\u2019s 130-year history. While attempting to escape the sights and sounds she is witnessing, Kristy runs into James, whose parents are the caretakers of the park. James listens to Kristy\u2019s plight and journeys with her to investigate these ghosts that have come alive to threaten her. He quickly determines that her frightening accounts are amazingly accurate. However, James discovers that he, too, is now trapped, along with Kristy, inside the park with these demons from the past. Searching futilely for an exit, the pair finds that various attractions\u2014long discarded and fallen into ruin\u2014suddenly come to life, tormenting them at every turn. As Kristy and James make their way through the remains of the park, they encounter a mysterious carny in clown makeup, who once was responsible for operating the amusement park\u2019s roller coaster but who died many years previously. He advises the couple that their only escape to freedom is to relive and survive all the life-threatening tales from the park\u2019s past and to ride the now-operational rides in the park one final time. The couple has no choice but to heed the baffling advice of their inexplicable guide, as he leads them through the park from one horror to another, so they might win their freedom. The looming question remains: will Kristy and James survive the deadly, mythical and mystical apparitions of this desolate and ruinous amusement park or simply become just one more urban legend of the infamous park?\n"}
