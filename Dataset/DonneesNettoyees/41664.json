It tells about a corrupt group of teenage misfits: the not-so-bright Megabom , the asthmatic Pablo , the nerdy Frula , and Sandra , the pregnant girlfriend of El Cordobes . All are squatters living together in the same house. The group wanders the city and steal in order to survive. Sandra, because she's pregnant, starts to think about her future and the life she can make for her expected baby. She tells Cordob\u00e9s that if he doesn't go straight, she'll leave him. But, when the gang robs a legless street vendor, Sandra is arrested. Instead of straightening up, Cordob\u00e9s finds a gun and borrows a 1971 Ford Fairlane in order to rob a restaurant. His plans go terribly wrong. \n"}
