However, his mission is finally realized in his devotion to the \u201cbroken blossom\u201d Lucy Burrows , the beautiful but unwanted and abused daughter of boxer Battling Burrows . After being beaten and discarded one evening by her raging father, Lucy finds sanctuary in Cheng\u2019s home, the beautiful and exotic room above his shop. As Cheng nurses Lucy back to health, the two form a bond as two unwanted outcasts of society. All goes astray for them when Lucy\u2019s father gets wind of his daughter's whereabouts and in a drunken rage drags her back to their home to punish her. Fearing for her life, Lucy locks herself inside a closet to escape her contemptuous father. By the time Cheng arrives to rescue Lucy, whom he so innocently adores, it is too late. Lucy\u2019s lifeless body lies on her modest bed as Battling has a drink in the other room. As Cheng gazes at Lucy\u2019s youthful face which, in spite of the circumstances, beams with innocence and even the slightest hint of a smile, Battling enters the room to make his escape. The two stand for a long while, exchanging spiteful glances, until Battling lunges for Cheng with a hatchet, and Cheng retaliates by shooting Burrows repeatedly with his handgun. After returning to his home with Lucy\u2019s body, Cheng builds a shrine to Buddha and takes his own life with a knife to the stomach.\n"}
