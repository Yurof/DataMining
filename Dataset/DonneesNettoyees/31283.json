The officers spot the robbers entering the bank and call it in. The manager is forced to open the vault and fill a duffel bag with all the cash in the branch. When the robbers are turned away from him the manager places a stack of notes with the dye used for tracking purposes. By the time Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu collect all the cash, numerous LAPD patrol cars and officers surround the branch and roadblocks are set up. The robbers spot the officers and exit the branch firing their weapons. The officers are unable to stop them because of their low-caliber weapons and also since the robbers are wearing heavy armor. Donnie listens to the call on his radio, gathers his SWAT team and races to the shoot-out location. After several minutes of firing and injuries to both and civilians, Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu decide to make a getaway.

On Archwood Street, Phillips separates from M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu and starts firing at the officers following them. While reloading, his rifle malfunctions. He draws his pistol and shoots himself through the chin. At the same time he is also shot by Frank. M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu car-jacks a 1963 Jeep Gladiator pickup truck after the tires on his getaway car are shot out. However, he is unable to start the truck since its driver abandoned the Jeep and took the keys. The SWAT team corners him and he takes cover behind his car. A close-range gun battle ensues. The SWAT team fires below the cars at M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu's legs since they are unprotected. Finally he goes down and surrenders. It is later shown that he bleeds to death.
