After three months, his new boss  invites himself and his wife Alice  to dinner at Alain's house. They arrive late and create a scene with their marital problems and Alice is then despicably rude to Benedicte. Things go downhill from there, beginning with Alain's discovery of an unconscious rodent lodged in the S-bend of the kitchen sink. When Alain pulls the animal out of the S-bend, it seems lifeless, but revives later. B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte takes it to a veterinarian, who identifies it with some surprise as a lemming, a Scandinavian animal that does not live in France in the wild. Alice, after an unsuccessful attempt at seducing Alain, turns up at his house in the day time and takes her own life. Alain and B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's idyllic home life begins to disintegrate.\n"}
