He happens to find a Scottish Terrier with no owner and takes him in. When the creature, now named \"Scotty\" tracks mud into the house, the kitten's grandmother says that her grandson cannot keep him. Thus, Scotty is kicked out. After some time, a transient bulldog is walking by as Grandma puts a pie in the window sill to cool. He barges into the house and terrorizes the family, demanding they feed him. Scotty rushes back to the house and saves the family, causing Grandma to decide that they can keep him after all.\n"}
