He commits battery to escape, and kidnaps a young woman named Connie  as he gets away. Frank drives off with Connie in her Jaguar. But she soon proves a difficult hostage, trying to escape a few times, which leads him to treat her more roughly than they both would prefer. This mutual struggle soon leads the two to fall in love with each other. Continuing to elude police, the couple slips into a cross-border sports car race, which Frank plans to take advantage of in order to escape into Mexico. But out of sympathy for Frank and a desire to be with him, Connie informs the police of the plan so he might face trial and be acquitted. And at the last moment he too decides it is better to turn himself in. The film ends with his capture by police imminent.\n"}
