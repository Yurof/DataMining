Ana dreams of leaving the village to see the world. Jusce is content with the life he leads. The other fishermen, friends of Jusce's dead father, help him to buy and fit out his own fishing boat. One day an old friend, Rog\u00e9rio, returns from the big city to work giving dune buggy rides along the coast. The day Rog\u00e9rio gives Jusce a ride to Ana's place marks the beginning of their rivalry for Ana's attention.
