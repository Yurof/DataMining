The film follows Jin and his crew as they tour Asia to promote Jin\u2019s debut album, The Rest is History. Along the way, we are treated to a fascinating glimpse into the life of a rapper, as well as the rapidly growing hip hop communities in Asian cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taipei, and Tokyo. The film gained wide acclaim and some shock from screening audiences at the Atlanta Film Festival as they reacted to the startling visage of Jamaican-American promoter Andrew Ballen speaking fluent Chinese on the Shanghai leg of the tour.\n"}
