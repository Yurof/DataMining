When George wrecks their classy sports car, they wake up from the accident as ghosts. Realizing they aren\u2019t in heaven or hell because they\u2019ve never been responsible enough to do good deeds or bad ones, they decide that freeing their old friend Cosmo Topper from his regimented lifestyle will be their ticket into heaven. Cosmo Topper, a wealthy Wall Street banker, is trapped in a boring job. Worse still, Clara, his social-climbing wife, seems only to care about nagging him and presenting a respectable fa\u00e7ade. On a whim, after George and Marion die, he buys George\u2019s flashy sports car. Soon he meets the ghosts of his dead friends, and immediately they begin to liven up his dull life with drinking and dancing, flirting and fun. The escapades lead quickly to Cosmo\u2019s arrest, and the ensuing scandal alienates his wife Clara. When Cosmo moves out, however, she fears she has lost him forever. Her loyal butler suggests that she lighten up a bit; she decides he\u2019s right and dons the lingerie and other attire of \u201ca forward woman.\u201d After Cosmo has a near-death experience and nearly joins George and Marion in the afterlife, Cosmo and Clara are happily reunited, and George and Marion, their good deed done, gladly depart for heaven.\n"}
