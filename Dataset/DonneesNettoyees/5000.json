In the opening scene, Meir , a young Talmudic scholar, thanks God in his morning prayers for not being born a woman. At first, the marriage of Meir and his adoring wife, Rivka , appears tender and idyllic, but as the day progresses it becomes clear that Meir is obsessed with the fact that he is childless after ten years of marriage. Rivka's younger sister, Malka, marries Yosef in a match arranged by their parents, but loves Yaakov, a rock singer, who has abandoned the religious community.\n"}
