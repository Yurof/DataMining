Zigis is killed while attempting to desert to the Soviets. Twenty years later the two surviving friends meet again. J\u0101nis has stayed in Soviet Latvia and accepted the new order, while Ri\u010dards arrives from abroad, having become an agent to the Western powers hostile to the Soviet system. While produced during the Soviet period and being full of Soviet propaganda clich\u00e9s, the film rather objectively describes the events surrounding participation of Latvian Legion in battles against Soviets on the Leningrad Front during World War II.\n"}
