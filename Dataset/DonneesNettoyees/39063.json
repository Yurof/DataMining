He has chosen to live with two new roommates instead of his girlfriend Agn\u00e8s. As a result, with his studies, he has little time to see her. Agn\u00e8s perceives cracks in their relationship when she suspects Paul's attraction to one of his new roommates, the aristocratic Louis-Arnault. Paul denies any homosexual attraction, but Agn\u00e8s decides to make a bet with him: whichever of them beds Louis-Arnault first, wins. If she does, Paul must stop exploring his sexuality; if he does, she will leave him. Before the bet plays out, Paul meets M\u00e9cir, a young Arab worker, who becomes besotted with him. With M\u00e9cir, Paul goes on a journey of discovery that changes many of his ideas about class, cultural differences and sexuality.\n"}
