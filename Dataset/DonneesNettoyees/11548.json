In the third part we get much more of O\u2019s perception of the room and its contents. In order to distinguish between the two perceptions, objects seen by O were shot through a lens-gauze, blurring his perception while E's perception was shot without gauze or filters, keeping the images sharp.  The film opens onto a rippled image that fills the entire screen. Without colour it is hard at first to tell what we\u2019re looking at but it is alive. As it moves we realise it is an extreme close-up of an eyelid; it fills the entire screen. The eye opens, slowly, closes, opens again, blinks and then fades into a different rippled image, still somewhat organic but changed, still.\u201dWhen the rushes of the first frenetic day\u2019s outdoor filming were viewed, it was clear that it had been an almost total disaster \u2026 Yet the budget did not allow for the scene to be reshot \u2026 Hours were spent getting the exact close-up that they required of Buster Keaton\u2019s \u2018creased, reptilian\u2019 eye to replace the abandoned outdoor scene with the extras.\u201d \u2013 Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , pp 523,524 As the camera begins to pan right and up and we realise it is a wall; we are outside a building . It is summer though it is hard to tell. The camera\u2019s movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually it loses interest and pans left and down back to the wall. Suddenly the camera  shifts violently to the left. A man is hurrying along the wall from left to right. He pauses, hugging the wall and E gets a chance to focus on him. He has on a long dark overcoat, the collar of which is turned up and his hat is pulled down over his face. He is hanging onto a briefcase with his left hand whilst trying to shield the exposed side of his face with the other. He realises he\u2019s been seen and cowers against the wall; E quickly shifts behind him. No longer conscious of being observed, O starts off again, knocking over a trestle, stumbling over a railway sleeper, anything to stay as close as possible to the wall. He charges into a man and woman, knocking the man\u2019s hat off. E looks from the man\u2019s face to the woman\u2019s and back again. The man has a moustache and is wearing a pince-nez. They have been consulting a newspaper which the woman keeps hold of. They both look appalled at what has happened. E moves back to a long shot and watches O barge through and on his way. The man replaces his hat, takes off his pince-nez and looks after the fleeing figure. The couple look at each other and the man \u201copens his mouth to vituperate\u201dBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 165 but the woman shushes him, uttering the only sound in the whole play. Together they turn to stare directly at E and, as they do, an open-mouthed expression takes over their faces; they can\u2019t bear to look at what they\u2019ve seen and turn their faces away. The action shifts back to O just as he reaches and turns a corner. He heads off down the street until he realises he is at the right doorway. He enters.  The camera cuts to the vestibule. We are directly behind O. The stairs lead up on the left, but O veers right and pauses, pulling himself together. He takes his pulse and E moves in. As soon as he becomes aware of E's presence he rushes down a couple of steps and cowers beside the wall until the camera retreats a little. When it does he reverses back up to street-level and then begins up the stairs. A frail old woman is coming down. The camera gives us a brief close-up. \u201cShe carries a tray of flowers slung from her neck by a strap. She descends slowly and with fumbling feet.\u201dBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 166 O backs up and hurries down the steps to the right again where he sits down on a step and presses his face against the balusters. He glances up briefly to see where she is then hides his head from view. As the woman reaches the bottom of the stairs she looks straight into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that we saw displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. She closes her eyes and collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. We just catch his coat tails flying up the stairs. E chases after him and finds him at the top of the first flight. He looks around to see if there is anyone about. Satisfied he turns left and, not without some difficulty, opens the door to a room and enters. E slips in unnoticed as O locks the door behind him and then takes his pulse once more.  We find ourselves in a \u201csmall barely furnished room.Beckett\u2019s notes identify this as the man\u2019s mother\u2019s room. This recalls Molloy\u2019s return to his mother\u2019s room/womb/tomb to die. \u2013 Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E.,  The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett, , pp 195,383 The man \u2013 and the camera following him from behind \u2013 survey its contents: a dog and a cat share a basket, a caged parrot and a goldfish in its bowl sit atop a small table; the walls are bare apart from a mirror and an unframed picture of \u201cthe face of God the Father\u201dBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 167. The actual photograph was \u201csuggested to him by Avigdor Arikha [and] was a reproduction of a Sumerian head of God Abu in the Museum in Baghdad. \u2013 Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , p 523 pinned to the wall; there is a couch with a pillow, some blankets and a rug on it, a rocking chairThe rocking-chair is a common Beckettian prop, appearing in the opening chapter of Murphy, Rockaby, Molloy  and the abandoned Mime de r\u00eaveur, A. with a \u201ccuriously carved headrest\u201dBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 167 and there is a window with a tattered roller blind with full-length net curtains to either side.  Systematically O takes each object or creature in the room and disables its ability to \u2018see\u2019 him: he closes the blind and pulls the net curtains across, he covers the mirror with the rug, the cat and dog (\u201ca shy and uncooperative, little Chihuahua\u201dKnowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett  are \u2013 with some difficulty \u2013 ejected from the room and the picture is torn up. Although stated simply the mechanics needed to execute these tasks are laborious, e.g. as he passes the window he hides behind the blanket which he holds in front of himself to cover the mirror and he carries the cat and dog facing away from him as he tries to put them out the door. After all the above he goes to sit in the chair. There are two holes in the headrest that suggest eyes.In his manuscript notes Beckett had not envisioned these \u2018eye\u2019 holes but had written \u201cMake chair back memorable\u201d and foresaw an \u201cupright back, intersecting wooden bars or lozenges\u201d. \u2013 Notes for Film , quoted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , p 802 n 54 He ignores them and sits. O takes the folder from his case and goes to open it but there are \u201ctwo eyelets, well proportioned\u201d;Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett , p 524 he turns the folder through 90\u00b0 but he\u2019s disturbed by the parrot\u2019s eye and has to get up and cover the cage with his coat. : Keaton asked Beckett what O was wearing underneath. \u201cI hadn't thought of that,\u201d the author admitted and then proposed, \u201cthe same coat,\u201d which appealed to both men.<ref namePeriod in rocking chairInvestment proper . As O begins to doze off, E begins to move round to his left. Suddenly O realises he is being watched and turns his head violently to the right. E moves behind him again. He resumes rocking and dozes off. This time E whirls round to the right, passing the window, the mirror, the birdcage and fishbowl and finally stops in front of the space on the wall where the picture was. E turns around and, for the first time, we are face-to-face with O, asleep in his rocking chair. All of a sudden he wakes and stares straight into the camera lens. He looks very much like the man in the seventh photograph only much older. He still has the eye patch. He half starts from the chair then stiffens. Gradually the horrified look we have seen before on the couple and the old woman\u2019s faces appears on his. He is looking at himself but not the scruffy, wearish man we have been watching, the man before him, standing with a big nail beside his head, has a look of \u201cacute intentness\u201dBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett , p 169 on his face. O slumps back into the chair and starts rocking. He closes his eye and the expression fades. He covers his face with his hands briefly and then looks again. This time we see the face of E in close-up, just the eyes. O covers his eyes again, bows his head. The rocking dies down and then stops. The screen goes black. We then see the opening image of the eye, which is frozen, and the credits are presented over it. Once finished, the eye closes and the film is over.\n"}
