{"wikiId": "17115584", "titre": "Cockeyed Cowboys of Calico County", "dateSortie": "1970-04", "duree": "99.0", "genre": ["Western"], "resume": "In the film, a simple-minded blacksmith named Charley, well loved by the townsfolk, saves for a year to send off for a mail-order bride. However, when Charley, accompanied by many of the townsfolk, gather at the train station to greet the woman on her scheduled arrival date, Charley is publicly embarrassed when she fails to appear. Realizing that he has been suckered out of his savings and feeling like a fool, Charley plans to leave the town for good. This would not be an issue except that Charley is the town\u2019s only blacksmith and no one else is available to replace him. In order to persuade their only blacksmith to stay, the townsfolk recruit a saloon girl named Sadie to pose as Charley\u2019s mail-order bride. As Charley is a straight and narrow sort of person, he has never been in the saloon and does not immediately recognize the woman for what she really is. The film is about Charley\u2019s simple-minded efforts to see through the deceit and the townspeople\u2019s efforts to maintain the fiction that a saloon girl is as pure as the driven snow.\n"}
