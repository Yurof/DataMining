One of the best scenes of the film when B\u00f6be and many naked women - teachers and nurses - are waiting for casting in a film studio. B\u00f6be is acquainted with foreigners and she trades in foreign currencies. B\u00f6be will be arrested and she finally jumps out of the window of the teachers' accommodation. \"Szab\u00f3's sensitive handling of the material culminates in a meditative passage in which Emma stands in church, musing on the 'passion for love' which masks lack of purpose. 'Collective sin' may be dead, according to B\u00f6be, but this movingly delineates the private pain of atonement\"- Time Out Film Guide.\n"}
