The plot focuses on Ash Ketchum , a \"Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\" who commands creatures called Pok\u00e9mon to battle other Trainers' Pok\u00e9mon to advance within a league setting. Formerly a global sport, it was long since outlawed due to outcries of animal abuse, and instead continued in underground arenas, where the fighting became much more brutal. Despite warnings by his friend Brock , Ash takes part in the battles with his Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu. When approached by Giovanni , the head of Rocket Industries, with a bribe to throw his next fight, Ash turns the offer down. In response, Giovanni threatens Ash's former mentor Professor Oak and girlfriend, Misty . Deciding to keep them safe, Ash accepts the bribe, and Pikachu is nearly killed in the match. Quickly regretting his actions, Ash revisits Giovanni and returns the bribe money, declaring himself out of the league. Enraged, Giovanni declares Ash and his friends dead, and sends his minions Jessie, James  and Meowth to carry out the retribution. As a result, Oak is killed, Pikachu and Misty are assaulted, and Brock is tortured. With the help of Pikachu, Brock and Misty, Ash goes after Giovanni and aims to take down Rocket Industries, declaring he will not stop until he has \"caught them all\".\n"}
