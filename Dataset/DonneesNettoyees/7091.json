Tae-jung looks after Seung-young, and tries to help the stubborn and contrary youngster adjust to the strict hierarchies and harshness of military life. As time passes, Seung-young\u2019s resistance wears down, and he finds himself understanding, and even becoming more like the superior officers he previously struggled against. Matters come to a head when he is given command of Ji-hoon, a slovenly newcomer whose constant incompetence tests Seung-young\u2019s patience, and eventually forces him to act.\n"}
