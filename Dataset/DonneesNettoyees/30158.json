{"wikiId": "16198836", "titre": "The Grissom Gang", "dateSortie": "1971-05-28", "duree": "128.0", "genre": ["Thriller", "Crime Fiction", "Gangster Film", "Crime Drama", "Psychological thriller", "Period piece", "Drama", "Black comedy", "Crime Thriller", "Action"], "resume": "The story centers on a 1931 heiress kidnapped for ransom by a brutal gang, whose mentally-impaired \"leader\" (Scott Wilson   falls in love with her. It was previously filmed in England in 1949 under its original title, and the central conceit was that the heiress, who felt stifled by her upper-class life-style, fell in love with the abductor and his comparative freedom to live his life on the edge. In this remake, Aldrich and Griffiths reversed this angle; here, she merely strings him along in an attempt to escape. This version was also played more for laughs, in particular the outlandishly deranged behavior of the gang.\n"}
