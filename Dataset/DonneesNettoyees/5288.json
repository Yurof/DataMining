His success as a \"cooler\" is jeopardized when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario  seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luck&nbsp;\u2014 and that of those around him&nbsp;\u2014 takes a turn for the better. What Bernie doesn't know is that Shelly has paid the woman to seduce him into staying in town. What Shelly doesn't know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie, and vice versa. Additional complications arise when Shelly, an old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La advisers, including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov , to update the property and bring it into the 21st century.\n"}
