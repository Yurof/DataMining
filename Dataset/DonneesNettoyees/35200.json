{"wikiId": "19104102", "titre": "Barbara", "dateSortie": "1997-10-02", "duree": "143.0", "genre": ["Drama"], "resume": "The aptly named ship Fortuna arrives in T\u00f3rshavn, bringing Poul , the new pastor for the parish of V\u00e1gar, and the populace has gathered for the event. Among them is Barbara , the widow of two former pastors for whose untimely deaths she is blamed by many. Pastor Poul is warned about her but falls for her charms, despite the fact that when three French ships come to port she follows the example of most of the other women in the town and allows herself to be seduced by a French sailor. As the widow of the parish, she has a house of her own on V\u00e1gar, and she and Poul leave for their respective homes there. Inevitably, they marry, but when in T\u00f3rshavn on a subsequent visit, Barbara meets and falls for the foppish Andreas Heyde , on a research trip from Copenhagen. Poul persuades Barbara to leave with him; however, when Christmas approaches he feels duty-bound to visit the outlying island of Mykines, despite Barbara's entreaties that he not do so. Andreas has now arrived nearby to spend Christmas at the home of the chief magistrate of the island. Despite his misgivings, Poul answers the call of duty, hoping to return almost immediately, but he is delayed by the weather for eleven days, and on his return he discovers that Barbara has left for T\u00f3rshavn with Andreas. After a confrontation between Poul and Andreas, instigated by Gabriel, Andreas is finally persuaded to leave for Copenhagen, without Barbara, and she makes a desperate and futile attempt to reach his ship, once more the Fortuna, as it leaves.\n"}
