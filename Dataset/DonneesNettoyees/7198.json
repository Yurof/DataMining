Their relationship is strained, to say the least, as Alice finds herself in service to Nanny\u2019s unrelenting demands. Alice is subjugated to bizarre psychological and physical abuses from Nanny, who quickly reveals herself as Alice's worse nightmare. The final conflict comes as a result of Alice's adoption of a white rabbit. Nanny Dearest forbids having a \u201crodent\u201d as a pet  and sentences the poor bunny to death. Despite numerous creative attempts to put an end to the him, Nanny takes increasingly severe action when the \"damn rabbit keeps coming back.\" With Nanny\u2019s wickedness now revealed in full force, she instigates the ultimate solution, flushing the poor creature down the toilet. Engorged with her own mad power, Nanny flushes Alice down the \u201crabbit hole\u201d as well. Alice lands in a surreal \u201cWonderland\u201d  populated by perverse creatures who would make Lewis Carrol turn over in his grave. Alice's white rabbit, now incarnated as a rapping, hip-hop \u201cWhite Chocolate,\u201d becomes the first of many encounters with eccentric characters who have found their way into Wonderland, including a boozy Glinda the Good Witch , a hookah smoking Penispillar in his mushroom forest and a naughty Cheshire Cat, smiling for all the wrong reasons. Then, after stumbling upon Trannie Dee and Trannie Dum\u2019s trailer park where Alice is introduced to a little Wonderland magic, the Mad Hatter serves up Titmouse tea at a truly twisted Tea Party. When Alice ultimately crosses paths with the evil and insatiable Red Queen, she is offered her first Birthday Orgy. In a fit of jealousy, the King frames Alice with an illegal wire hanger, and the Queen invariably demands Alice\u2019s beheadment. Barely escaping with her head, Alice returns to the \u201creal world\u201d where she recognizes her past sins of using wire hangers and not eating enough red meat. With her work done, Nanny declares \u201cShe's off, Chim Chimeree and all that,\u201d to horrify another child... or so she thinks!\n"}
