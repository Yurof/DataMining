Embarking on an expedition as a young boy, Tem\u00fcjin  is accompanied by his father Yes\u00fcgei  to select a girl as his future wife. Tem\u00fcjin meets and chooses B\u00f6rte , although his father wishes him to choose a mate from the Merkit tribe. Tem\u00fcjin convinces his father to allow him to choose B\u00f6rte. He promises to return after five years to marry her. On their way home, Tem\u00fcjin's father is poisoned by an enemy tribe. As he lies dying, he tells Tem\u00fcjin that he is now Khan. However, one of his father's warriors, Targutai , orders the other tribesmen to loot the dead Khan's camp. Targutai spares Tem\u00fcjin's life, declaring a Mongol does not kill children. After falling through the ice of a frozen lake, Tem\u00fcjin is found lying down in the snow by a young boy called Jamukha . The two quickly become friends and perform a traditional ceremony declaring themselves blood brothers. Targutai later captures Tem\u00fcjin, holding him in captivity. Tem\u00fcjin however, escapes late one night and roams the countryside. Tem\u00fcjin is later seen again as a young man  in 1186. He once again is apprehended by Targutai, who wishes to kill him now that he is grown. Tem\u00fcjin escapes a second time finding B\u00f6rte , and brings her back to his family. Later that night, they are attacked by the Merkit tribe led by Chiledu , since Tem\u00fcjin's father had years before stolen his wife from one of their tribesmen. While being chased on horseback, Tem\u00fcjin is shot with an arrow. B\u00f6rte whips the horse which Tem\u00fcjin is on, telling it to go home. B\u00f6rte is captured by the Merkit leader, as Tem\u00fcjin returns safely to his family. Tem\u00fcjin is sold to a Tangut Garrison Chief , despite the dire warning given to the man by a Buddhist monk  acting as his advisor, who senses the great potential the warrior carries and his future role in subjugating the Tangut state. While imprisoned, the monk pleads with Tem\u00fcjin to save his monastery when he is set free sometime in the future. In exchange for delivering a bone fragment to B\u00f6rte indicating that he is still alive, Tem\u00fcjin agrees. Thereafter, the monk succeeds in delivering the bone and the message, though at the cost of his life. As a means of getting to Tangut, B\u00f6rte becomes a merchant's concubine, bearing a daughter along the way. Once B\u00f6rte arrives in Tangut, she abandons the merchant and bribes the guard for the key to Tem\u00fcjin's cell, and the two manage to escape back to their homeland. Tem\u00fcjin, upset by the increasing loss of traditional values in Mongol society, leaves his family once more and pledges to make the Mongols abide by the law. Visiting a holy site in the mountains, he drafts an early version of the Jasagh and prays to \"The Lord of the Great Blue Sky\" for assistance. Subsequently, he gathers an army to unify all of the Mongols. In 1196, Tem\u00fcjin declares war over Jamukha. By 1206, Tem\u00fcjin engages Jamukha, in league with his old enemy, Targutai, in battle. However, a thunderstorm arises on the steppe, terrifying Jamukha's troops and causing their unconditional surrender, as Tem\u00fcjin stands triumphant . Having defeated his \"blood brother\", Tem\u00fcjin allows Jamukha to live, while Targutai is killed by his own soldiers while attempting to flee the battle. The traitorous men are ordered to be executed by Tem\u00fcjin, who surprises them when he informs them that they broke his primary tenet: \"Never betray your Khan.\" Afterwards, Tem\u00fcjin is designated the Khan of all the Mongols \u2013 Genghis Khan of the Great Steppe. The final pre-credits sequence indicates that Genghis Khan would later go on to invade and conquer the Tangut Empire by 1227, fulfilling the monk's prophecy. However, the film clarifies that, while the entire civilization was ravaged by the Mongol horde, the Buddhist monastery Tem\u00fcjin pledged never to destroy remained intact, thereby indicating the great integrity and honesty of the Khan.\n"}
