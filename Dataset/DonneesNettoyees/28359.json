The town is overridden by corruption, prostitution and organized crime. People of Te\u0161anj live in peace, though the war scars are visible everywhere in town, as well as in people's souls. The population of Te\u0161anj are almost exclusively ethnic Bosniaks. Ethnic Serbs live in surrounding villages. It is announced that U.S. president Bill Clinton will pay a visit to the town. Western bureaucrats arrive to Te\u0161anj to supervise the preparations for the visit. Everything in the town must be in order, including the faked brotherhood between Bosniaks and Serbs.\n"}
