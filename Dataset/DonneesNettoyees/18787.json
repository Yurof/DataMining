One night, a large fixed-wing cargo aircraft from the kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley. Nausica\u00e4 tries to rescue an onboard passenger, the wounded Princess Lastelle of Pejite, who pleads with Nausica\u00e4 to destroy the cargo before dying. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, lethal genetically engineered bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Initially discovered by Pejite, the invading Tolmekians seized the embryo and Lastelle. The Tolmekian plane, however, was attacked by mutant insects before it crashed. The next morning, Tolmekian troops, led by Princess Kushana and Officer Kurotowa, subjugate the Valley and secure the Giant Warrior embryo, killing Nausica\u00e4's sick father in the process. Kushana plans to mature the Giant Warrior and then use it to burn the Toxic Jungle, even though history warns of fatal consequences. Kushana announces her decision to leave for Pejite along with five hostages from the Valley and Nausica\u00e4. Before leaving, Nausica\u00e4's master discovers her secret garden of jungle plants. According to Nausica\u00e4, plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic. The jungle's soil, however, has long been tainted by man. Kushana and her detachment never reach their destination, as an agile Pejite interceptor decimates the entire Tolmekian wing before being shot down. Nausica\u00e4, her fellow hostages and Kushana crash-land in the jungle, disturbing several Ohmus, which Nausica\u00e4 soothes. She then leaves to rescue Asbel, the Pejite pilot and the twin brother of Lastelle, but both are swallowed by quicksand and end up in a non-toxic world below the jungle. Nausica\u00e4 realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water that remains hidden underground. Nausica\u00e4 and Asbel return to Pejite, only to find it ravaged by the insects. Pejite survivors, boarding a single plane, reveal that they lured the creatures to eradicate the Tolmekians and would do the same in the Valley to recapture the Giant Warrior. To prevent any intervention, they take Nausica\u00e4 captive, knocking Asbel out in process. Later, with the help of Asbel and his mother, Nausica\u00e4 flees on a glider. While flying home, Nausica\u00e4 finds a team of Pejites using a wounded baby Ohmu to lead scores of enraged Ohmus into the Valley. Tolmekians deploy tanks and later the Giant Warrior against the herd to no avail: tanks prove too weak and the Giant Warrior, hatched ahead of time, soon disintegrates. Nausica\u00e4 liberates the baby Ohmu and gains its trust; in the process, her pink dress becomes stained by the Ohmu's blue blood, turning completely blue. Both land in front of the herd, but are run over. The herd, however, calms down, and the Ohmus use their golden tentacles to heal Nausica\u00e4's wounded body. Nausica\u00e4 awakens and starts to dance on top of the hundreds of glowing golden tentacles. Thus Nausica\u00e4, \"clad in blue, surrounded by the fields of gold\" fulfills the prophecy. The Ohmus and Tolmekians leave the Valley afterward, while the surviving Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them rebuild. Meanwhile underground, a tree is beginning to grow meaning the planet is beginning to heal.\n"}
