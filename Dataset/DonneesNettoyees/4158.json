{"wikiId": "19960374", "titre": "Le Grand Akshan", "dateSortie": "2003", "duree": "58.0", "genre": ["Documentary"], "resume": "Reading a newspaper article about the search for the remains of the Struma, which sunk carrying Jewish refugees from Axis-allied Romania to Palestine, Goldman is shocked when his grandmother reveals that his great-great-grandfather Luzer was one of the more than 700 passengers who perished that day in the waters of the Black Sea. This once-unspoken family history leads Goldman to dig deeper and further, until he has revealed a narrative that is deeply complex, and says more about his legacy than his ancestors ever hoped to share. At the center of this narrative is Goldman\u2019s great-grandfather, Luger\u2019s son Grisha, a man whose tenacity earned him the professional nickname, Le Grand Akshan, or \u201cthe truly stubborn one.\u201d Goldman once considered his great-grandfather a source of embarrassment because of the corny middle name he inherited from the mysterious \u201cman with the sharp, piercing look\u201d whose picture hung in his grandmother\u2019s study. He is shocked to learn the central role that Grisha played in helping his family escape the Holocaust. His heroics involved a harrowing series of moves that took him to Romania, Iraq, India and, eventually, the young state of Israel, where Grisha entered the nascent cinema industry. Goldman becomes fascinated with his great-grandfather, and the drive to learn more about him fuels Goldman to complete the film.\n"}
