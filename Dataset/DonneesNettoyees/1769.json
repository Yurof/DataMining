She only knows his name: Kim Jong-wook. Heading the business is Gi-joon , who is young, single and male, and equipped with goofy charm. Stubbornly precise by nature and a bit too passionate about work, Gi-joon is determined to complete his first job, even if it means he has to track down every Kim Jong-wook in Korea! The heroine is a disheveled and foulmouthed theater director who has yet to make amends with her inability to finish or start anything substantial in both her love life and career. The hero is a naive guy with an obsessive compulsive fixation on order, safety and hygiene \u2014 manifested in his perfectly pressed attire and color coded post-its \u2014 who has yet to leap into a whirlwind life experience. The two are polar opposites yet eventually grow fond of each other as they bicker along the way to find Ji-woo\u2019s elusive Mr. Destiny \u2014 and it\u2019s a long journey since there are 1,108 men who have the same name as her ex-boyfriend, from a Buddhist monk to an overweight farmer and a really unctuous plastic surgeon, to name a few. As Gi-joon and Ji-woo travel around the country trying to find her first love, Gi-joon finds himself falling for his client instead.http://www.yesasia.com/us/finding-mr-destiny-dvd-first-press-limited-edition/1024221728-0-0-0-en/info.html\n"}
