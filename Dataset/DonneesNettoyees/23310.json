Although the incident was years ago, it has apparently left an indelible mark in her life as she could not forget him. Enter Kar Bo , an undercover cop, was involved in a drug bust-up which would later incriminate him. Hitomi stumbles into him and was amazed that he looked remarkably similar to her dead lover. They soon found themselves having strong feelings for each other, although at the same time, he has to flee to China as things have gone from bad to worse for him. What invariably follows is a constant cat-and-mouse game of running away from authorities who were tipped off as to his location and only ends when Kar Bo reached a ranch belonging to an old friend . Surprisingly, Hitomi, although conscious as to the fact that Kar Bo can never be as close to being the real Tetsuya, endures his hardships with him unfailingly and tests the resolve of both these troubled lovers.\n"}
