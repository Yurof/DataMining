They slip into the country and contact Carnaghan's associate, the Dutchman , who conveniently recruits a gang of cutthroats for them from customers in his saloon, including Romano . Using money and intimidation, they succeed in purchasing all the available rubber, but eventually the Japanese commander, Colonel Tomura , gets wind of the scheme. On the last trip to transport the remainder of the cargo to a waiting freighter, Carnaghan smells an ambush, but Royer disregards his warning and is killed by the waiting soldiers. The cynical Carnaghan then turns patriotic and completes the mission.\n"}
