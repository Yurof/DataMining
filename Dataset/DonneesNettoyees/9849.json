You don\u2019t know who\u2019s gay or straight or who\u2019s with whom. As their stories unfold and stereotypes fall by the wayside, you won\u2019t care because you\u2019ll be rooting for everybody. With candor, good humor, great music and real heart, Inlaws & Outlaws gets past all the rhetoric to embrace what we have in common: We love.http://www.inlawsandoutlawsfilm.com/about/the_pitch.php\n"}
