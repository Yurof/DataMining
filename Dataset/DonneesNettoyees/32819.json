While on vacation with their neighbors at a house in the country, Karel decides to buy the house at the suggestion of his neighbor. When he is fixing up the house, he digs up a tree stump that looks vaguely like a baby. He spends the rest of the evening cleaning it up and then presents it to his wife. She names the stump Ot\u00edk and starts to treat it like a real baby. She then works out a plan to fake her pregnancy and becoming more and more impatient she speeds up the process and 'gives birth' one month early. Ot\u00edk comes alive and has an insatiable appetite. Al\u017eb\u011btka , the neighbor's daughter, has been suspicious all along, and when she reads the fairy tale about Otes\u00e1nek, the truth becomes clear to her. Meanwhile little Ot\u00edk has been just eating and growing. At one point he eats some of Bo\u017eena's hair, and another day she returns home to find that Ot\u00edk has eaten their cat. Karel and his wife are at odds with Karel pushing for killing the thing and Bo\u017eena defending it as their child. The baby later consumes a postal worker  and then a social worker . The resulting deaths lead Karel to tie up and lock Ot\u00edk away in the basement of their apartment building, leaving Ot\u00edk to starve. Al\u017eb\u011btka secretly takes over as prime caretaker. She tries to keep Ot\u00edk fed with normal human food, but, when her mother stops her, she is forced to drawing straws  to choose a person to feed to Ot\u00edk. The first victim is an old man and pedophile, Mr. \u017dl\u00e1bek , and the second victim is Karel himself, who had come with a chainsaw but on seeing Ot\u00edk calls him \"son\" and drops the chainsaw. Afterwards, Bo\u017eena goes into the basement and is heard screaming. In the end, Ot\u00edk disobeys Al\u017eb\u011btka despite repeated warnings and eats the cabbage patch of the pan\u00ed spr\u00e1vcov\u00e1 , meaning porter's wife or an old woman.  In the fairy tale upon which the movie is based, the old woman kills Otesanek by splitting his stomach open with a hoe, however, the film ends with her descending the stairs, Al\u017eb\u011btka reciting the end of the fairy tale tearfully; the audience is not allowed to witness the deed.\n"}
