Brutus  uses every trick in the book to have his own team win the game, and get rid of his father Julius Caesar  in the process, but fails. The film is very loosely adapted from the original Asterix at the Olympic Games comic book. The love story subplot between Lovesix and Irina was not featured in the original story. Brutus, portrayed here as a comical villain with no relation to his depictions in Asterix comics, is the main antagonist, although he was not even featured as a character in the original comic book.\n"}
