{"wikiId": "12285168", "titre": "Bless the Beasts and Children", "dateSortie": "1971-07-30", "duree": "109.0", "genre": ["Animal Picture", "Drama", "Childhood Drama"], "resume": "The story follows a group of six teenaged boys, who share a cabin at a residential summer camp in the western mountains. Each of the boys is a misfit in one way or another; the group is ostracized by the other boys at the camp, and form a bond based, in part, on this broader social isolation. After being taken on a field trip to see a captured herd of bison that is being slaughtered by local hunters, the boys resolve to sneak away from the camp and set the penned bison free. The film is presented partially out of sequence; the primary narrative of freeing the bison is interspersed with flashback scenes showing the boys' troubled lives both at the camp, and at their homes.\n"}
