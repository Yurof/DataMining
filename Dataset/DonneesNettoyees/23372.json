Franz is not quite sure why he agreed to come home with L\u00e9opold as he is supposed to be meeting his fianc\u00e9e Anna, but he accepts drinks from L\u00e9opold and they begin to get to know each other. Franz tells L\u00e9opold that he is not sure whether or not he loves Anna, that he does not really enjoy sex with her, finding more pleasure in books, theatre and life in general. L\u00e9opold asks him if he has ever slept with a man. Franz says he has not, but describes a dream where a man comes into his bedroom in an overcoat and has sex with him. L\u00e9opold says that although he once lived with a woman for seven years, he has always found sex with men more exciting. They kiss, and L\u00e9opold tells Franz to get undressed and into bed. He then appears beside the bed in an overcoat ready to re-enact Franz's dream.  Six months later, Franz is living happily with L\u00e9opold. He stays at home while L\u00e9opold goes on business trips. When L\u00e9opold returns, Franz tends to his every need and has become very passive. L\u00e9opold has become very domineering. The two men spend a great deal of time arguing and Franz worries about L\u00e9opold leaving him, but they still have a satisfying physical relationship. One night, a melancholy L\u00e9opold confesses that he believes he has driven one of his customers to commit suicide. Franz, unsure how to comfort L\u00e9opold, seduces him, and they perform the role-play from their first night together, this time with roles reversed.  Franz and L\u00e9opold are still enjoying sex together but the animosity between them is growing. Franz threatens to leave, but does not go through with it. When L\u00e9opold is away on business, Franz is bored and depressed. He finds a gun and imagines shooting himself. One day his ex-fianc\u00e9e Anna  visits. She sees how unhappy he is and tells him that she still loves him and wants to be with him. They kiss, and Franz acts out the \"man in overcoat\" sequence with her.  Franz and Anna have been sleeping together in L\u00e9opold's apartment for two days. She has convinced him to leave and happily talks about the children they will have together. Although he still loves L\u00e9opold, Franz agrees that he should leave. L\u00e9opold returns from work early and finds them packing. When Anna tells him that Franz is leaving, L\u00e9opold just laughs and tells Franz to get them some coffee. L\u00e9opold's ex-girlfriend V\u00e9ra  arrives and L\u00e9opold introduces her, explaining that she is a male-to-female transsexual. V\u00e9ra is still in love with L\u00e9opold. He then tells them that V\u00e9ra used to like being tied up, and that Franz likes it too. Franz, angry at being humiliated by the older man, says they are leaving, but Anna wants to stay. L\u00e9opold wants them all to have fun together. L\u00e9opold starts ordering the two women about. They are excited and start getting him whatever he wants. Franz is disgusted. L\u00e9opold tells him that although he does not need Franz, Franz needs him. When L\u00e9opold and the women go to the bedroom. Franz goes to join them but changes his mind. He fantasises about murdering L\u00e9opold. In the bedroom, V\u00e9ra realises that the others do not need her and leaves them to it. She finds Franz lying on the floor crying. She tells him that she is L\u00e9opold's \"creature\", that after he stopped desiring her, she had a sex change operation for him. This worked for a while but L\u00e9opold eventually left V\u00e9ra. Franz tells her that she is still beautiful and despite the fact that they both love L\u00e9opold, she suggests that they get together. Franz tells her that it is too late. He has taken some poison and is dying. He says that he is L\u00e9opold's creature too. Franz dies. When V\u00e9ra tells L\u00e9opold, he seems unconcerned. Anna is shocked and upset to lose the father of her future children, but when L\u00e9opold tells her to get back into bed, she does. L\u00e9opold asks V\u00e9ra to join them in bed, telling her that although he does not need her, she needs him.\n"}
