The film was directed by Hong Kong's Jeffrey Lau. Stephen Chow is Leon, a mental patient/ghostbuster who attempts to replicate the character L\u00e9on from the 1994 French film The Professional who talks to his plant for assistant, co-starring Karen Mok as Ah Qun, a curious young girl who gets caught up with all the spooky situations; the pair then unites together with the help of a brigade of quirky security guards in an attempt to get rid of the evil lurking in a supposedly haunted apartment building situated in Hong Kong.1\n"}
