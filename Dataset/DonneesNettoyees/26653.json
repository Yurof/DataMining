It begins with McGee and his close friend Meyer moored underneath a bridge while fishing, when a young woman  is thrown over it weighted with a cement block wired around her ankles. McGee dives in and saves, only to be surprised when she adamantly insists that there be no contacting the police. She admits that the reason for the murder attempt was her involvement in a prostitution ring and a murder scheme. The trio eventually travels to Nassau to investigate the still-continuing murderers, who work in male/female pairs and lure rich, lonely men traveling on Caribbean cruises in to their confidence. The climax of the story involves McGee and Meyer dismantling the operation.\n"}
