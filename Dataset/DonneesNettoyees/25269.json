Toby brings Flicka with him, and Kelly quickly befriends the beautiful horse. Kelly\u2019s former friend, Stephanie, boards her horse at the stables. Stephanie felt slighted by Kelly after Kelly\u2019s father died. She develops a growing dislike of Kelly and increasingly treats her like some lower class servant. When Stephanie\u2019s dressage teammate is injured, Flicka helps Kelly win a spot on the team, much to the chagrin of Stephanie. The jealousy grows even worse when Briggs McBride, the team\u2019s male member, shows more interest in Kelly than Stephanie.\n"}
