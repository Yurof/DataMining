{"wikiId": "345105", "titre": "D.C. Sniper: 23 Days of Fear", "dateSortie": "2003-10-17", "duree": "85.0", "genre": ["Thriller", "Drama"], "resume": "The movie chronicles the period when John Allen Muhammad  and Lee Boyd Malvo  went on a serial shooting spree in October 2002 in Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Maryland, all parts of the Washington Metropolitan Area, the entire area of which was held in a grip of terror. Unable to give anything but small pieces of information at various press conferences held during the 23 dark days, Moose finds himself vilified and derided in many corners as ineffectual and incompetent. Indeed, quite a few newspapers outside the area targeted by snipers came right out and called for Moose's resignation. But the chief's dogged persistence ultimately paid off and &mdash; in the sort of twist that a professional writer of thrillers might dismiss as inconceivable &mdash; the two men arrested for the carnage turned out to be the archetypal \"least likely suspects.\"\n"}
