In a busy downtown hospital, a visit from his former socio-pathic cellmate Bug  has just gotten Dick  fired from his job as a hospital janitor. Unemployed and in need of fast cash Dick gets the idea to rob one of the day\u2019s brand new ATM's, to \u201cbuy a little self-respect\u201d, announces Dick to Bug and the team. Enter the charismatic, criminally-minded Donnie,  and the front-man, the sexy, sleepy-eyed charmer Billy,  and all of the pieces are in place.\"Review on Twitch\" \u201cIt\u2019s a precision job,\u201d says Dick the night before the heist: \u201cNo violence.\u201d You think? Naturally things don\u2019t go according to plan and the unfolding catalogue of disasters that confronts Dick is enough to test any friend\u2019s loyalties as the lovable losers bungle their way toward a pipe-dream of quick riches. Alternately tragic and hysterical, High Life\u2019s perfect plan ends up anything but when one of the bank\u2019s employees double-crosses them all. Set against the nostalgic back-beat of Three Dog Night, Creedence Clearwater Revival and a raft of April Wine\"High Life in Atlantic Film Festival\", High Life\u2019s highwire tension unfolds with calamitous results.\n"}
