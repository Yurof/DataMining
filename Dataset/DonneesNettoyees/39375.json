Charmed with a talent for delivering both justice and compassion, De Ming is quick to win the hearts of the town residents\u2014though none more completely than that of Su Mei, a fellow officer who also happens to be the object of the captain\u2019s secret affection. Nothing in De Ming\u2019s programming has prepared him for this. But affairs of the heart are put on hold when word arrives that one of De Ming\u2019s cybernetic siblings, the K-88, has disappeared after suffering a critical neural meltdown.
