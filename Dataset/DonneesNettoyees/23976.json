She hasn\u2019t had a book published in three years and is all too cognizant of this fact. Things look up when her old friend Seo-yeon calls from Vietnam. Seo-Yeon informs Yun-hee about a local Vietnamese folklore centered around a girl named \u201cMuoi\u201d and her haunted portrait. It just so happens that in Yun-hee\u2019s prior novel, she wrote a semi-autobiographical tale concerning her friends titled \u201cSecrets & Lies\u201d. In the book Seo-Yeon was portrayed in the most horrible manner, but Yun-hee is sure that Seo-Yeon hasn\u2019t read the book as she has been living in Vietnam for years. Yun-hee eagerly flies to Vietnam to learn more about Muoi.\n"}
