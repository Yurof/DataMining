One story line involves Linda Sykes , an American woman detained in the People's Republic of China, being interrogated by a military officer . In the other storyline, Sharif Bin Said , an Arab man detained in New York City, is interrogated by two FBI agents . Both characters are graduate students detained with no hard evidence and interrogated about unspecified activities which may or may not be related to terrorist plots. In the course of the increasingly brutal interrogations, both Sykes and Bin Said are strip searched against their will by their interrogators and are subjected to a cavity search. In both cases the protagonists appear to have only tenuous connections with the suspected terrorist plots. The film ends with the question: \"Must security and safety come at the price of freedom?\"\n"}
