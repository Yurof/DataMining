{"wikiId": "23862669", "titre": "Inside the Revolution: A Journey into the Heart of Venezuela", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "65.0", "genre": ["Documentary"], "resume": "The film begins by situating the rise of Hugo Chavez within the context of a history of political turmoil in Venezuela beginning with the fall of the Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez dictatorship in 1958 and climaxing with the popular uprising known as the Caracazo in 1989. From there the film charts the trajectory of Hugo Chavez's presidency through its infamous conflicts with the opposition, the failed coup attempt in 2002 and the series of reforms, Chavez's supporters believe, promote a protagonistic democracy along socialist principles. In the final part the film examines in closer detail the opinions and tensions within the movement regarding Chavez, US imperialism and what the future holds for Venezuela. In particular the film focuses on whether the Bolivarian Revolution represents a real alternative to capitalism or will suffer the same fate of previous socialist experiments.\n"}
