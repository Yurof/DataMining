The opening scene is some poorly duplicated stock footage of rockets blasting off and low budget special effects. In the movie, Thora, the Arkonide expedition\u2019s commander is a platinum blonde with a wardrobe of skintight spacesuits. The film adds an intriguing subplot about a super criminal that doesn\u2019t appear in the novel. The evil \u2018Homer Larkin\u2019 plots to get the Moon's wealth before Terra\u2019s governments take it all for themselves. Mr. Larkin has a pet similar to the running gag in James Bond movies.\n"}
