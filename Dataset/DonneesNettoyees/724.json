Civil war erupts when newly elected Mexican president, Plutarco El\u00edas Calles , begins a violent and relentless crackdown against the country's Catholic faithful. The film depicts the carnage by showing churches being set on fire, nuns subjected to extreme harassment, Catholic priests murdered and countless faithful peasants killed and then publicly hanged on telegraph poles. The story shifts to Father Christopher , a Catholic priest, who is ruthlessly murdered by the Federales . The killing is witnessed by a thirteen-year-old boy named Jos\u00e9 Luis Sanchez . Driven by anger and rage, Jos\u00e9 joins the rebels, or Cristeros , fighting against Calles. Their battle cry is \"\u00a1Viva Cristo Rey!\" . The rebel leader, retired general Enrique Gorostieta , an agnostic, takes an interest in young Jos\u00e9 and the boy soon becomes his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Later while fighting against the Federales, Jos\u00e9 is captured in a firefight and is tortured to force him to renounce his belief in God. When he resolutely defends his faith, he is executed. The next year Gorostieta is killed in a battle at Jalisco.\n"}
