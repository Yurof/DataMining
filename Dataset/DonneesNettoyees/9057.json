William Cagney , as 2nd Lt. Tom Cooper, gets the nickname \u201cSoapy\u201d, from his friend, 1st Lt. Richard \u201cDick\u201d Wood, \u201cWoody\u201d.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025424/ Tom finds out that \u201cIda Johnson\u201d, the girl he\u2019s been seeing, while Dick\u2019s been off the base, is really Evelyn Worthington, June Collyer, Dick\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who introduced herself, using her maid\u2019s name, played by Hattie McDaniel, as a lark. But, it's no joke, when Dick finds the tell-tale bar of soap. The two pilots are picked to go on a dangerous mission into the stratosphere, with a balloon, to test high altitude flight; but, the friendship, and the engagement are off, before they get off the ground. The Generals keep reminding them that the equipment is more important than they are. It doesn\u2019t look like either of them will survive; until, Evelyn begs them, to save the love of her life and his friend, by ordering them to bail out.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/81872/Lost-in-the-Stratosphere/ Unfortunately, the two are \"lost in the stratosphere\", when a thunderstorm takes them thousands of miles off course.\n"}
