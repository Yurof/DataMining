However, a series of disturbing, gory homicides begin to terrorize V\u00edctor's community, and the news of a \"killer on the loose\" are quickly spread. The media warns about the killer's habit of dismembering victims to the point of leaving them unrecognizable, and that the killer is a master of disguise with more than 300 victims. The authorities, on the other hand, don't really seem to care much about the wellbeing of El Barrio's inhabitants. But the rebellious V\u00edctor, far from dismayed by this lack of government interest, decides he will investigate the matter personally, as according to him, these are not just dead people anymore - they're dead Latinos. After consulting El Padrino, a santer\u00eda-practising wise man, V\u00edctor teams up with his delusional and odd friends in order to stop the killer, \"Manga Latina\" style. V\u00edctor's group, besides of Chucho, consists of Bello , thin and paranoid, who is sure that the killer is after him for no particular reason; Ricky, a pothead and green-haired man, who is worried that the killer will get him because of his lightheadness; and the Sisters C.C., Claudia and Camila, who just join in to protect El Barrio. Nevertheless, all they seem to be able to do is hang around Rafa's cafeteria, where coffee is always free no matter what, waiting for the latest news on the killer's attacks, and driving around Chucho's car with a megaphone telling people to stay home. Eventually, the media starts to give out vague hints to recognize the killer, so vague that the killer could be anybody. Regardless, V\u00edctor starts to suspect an unnamed pi\u00f1ata maker, or a British musician, both of whom make life impossible for the other inhabitants from El Barrio .\n"}
