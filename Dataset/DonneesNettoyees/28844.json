{"wikiId": "6799781", "titre": "Sim\u00f3n del desierto", "dateSortie": "1965", "duree": "45.0", "genre": ["Art film", "World cinema", "History", "Surrealism", "Satire", "Drama", "Comedy"], "resume": "Sim\u00f3n, the son of Simeon Stylites, has lived for 6 years, 6 weeks and 6 days atop an eight-meter pillar in the middle of the desert, praying for spiritual purification. A congregation of priests and peasants salute him and offer him a brand new pillar to stand on and carry on his mission. He comes down the pillar and is offered priesthood, but refuses because he considers himself unworthy, and forsakes his aging mother for the love of God before climbing up his new pillar. He heals an amputee missing both hands, whose first use of them is to slap his child. But the congregation quickly departs unimpressed, leaving Sim\u00f3n alone. Time goes by and Sim\u00f3n meets a number of regular characters \u2013 a handsome priest whom he condemns on grounds of vanity, a dwarf herder and his mother, who comes to live close to him but remains neglected of attention. A woman , Satan, visits him three times: first as an innocent girl chanting curses in Latin, second disguised as Jesus Christ. She constantly tries to make Sim\u00f3n give up his task and climb down the pillar, but he refuses every time. She even possesses one of the priests that visit him, who is consequently exorcised by the priests. The third time, a coffin trails across the desert and finally stops next to the pillar. It opens up to reveal Satan, clad in a toga, who at last climbs up the pillar and vanishes with Sim\u00f3n for good. In an anachronistic turn, the couple find themselves sitting inside a crowded, jumping 1960s nightclub with a live instrumental rock band on stage. Satan tells Sim\u00f3n that the song the 1960s hipsters are dancing to is called \"Radioactive Flesh.\" Sim\u00f3n protests about wanting to go home, but Satan says he cannot.\n"}
