Unfortunately, the New Zealand-harbored SS Berwind isn't exactly the luxury ocean liner he dreamed of commanding\u2014it is a utilitarian freighter whose captain has recently died. His crew is also a disappointment, often ill-tempered with their own plans for the ship's fate: two members of the crew, Leroy Martin  and Henry Scott  have concoted a scheme to murder the ship's crew and Rumill and sell the ship for salvage to the highest bidder, expecting to earn around a million dollars.
