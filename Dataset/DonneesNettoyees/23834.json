While at the British Embassy seeking help, he notices an announcement of an available apartment and decides to check the place out. He finds himself at the residence of Christine Easton  who insists that it would be improper to take him in as a housemate\u2014for while she forgot to advertise so, she naturally preferred a woman. Easton eventually lets Rutland stay\u2014half because she is persuaded it is her patriotic duty to take him in and half because of Rutland\u2019s own self-assured pushiness. Rutland then sublets half of his half of the cramped space to American Olympic competitor Steve Davis . While Easton is less than thrilled with the arrangement, she has to put up with it, as she has already spent Rutland's share of the rent. Rutland sets about playing matchmaker for the two young people, in spite of their disparate personalities and Easton\u2019s engagement to boringly dependable British diplomat Julius P. Haversack . Davis repeatedly refuses to reveal what sport he is competing in. Rutland meddles in the young couple's romantic troubles. To further his matchmaking, he even strips down to his boxer shorts and a t-shirt so he can pretend to be a competitor and talk to Davis during his event, race walking, and try to heal the breach between the young lovers.\n"}
