{"wikiId": "7874383", "titre": "Svengali", "dateSortie": "1930-05-22", "duree": "81.0", "genre": ["Thriller", "Horror", "Black-and-white", "Mystery", "Drama", "Suspense"], "resume": "The ending of the novel is changed in this film to a highly dramatic one by having Trilby die after Svengali is stricken with a fatal heart attack, instead of dying of a mysterious illness a few days later. She faints after he collapses in the stage box, but Svengali revives long enough to gasp, \"Oh God, grant me in death what you denied me in life- the woman I love\". Trilby then dies, followed by Svengali. In the film Billee survives.\n"}
