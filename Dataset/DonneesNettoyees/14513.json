{"wikiId": "29174042", "titre": "Toll Booth", "dateSortie": "2010-10-09", "duree": "97.0", "genre": ["Drama"], "resume": "Kenan is a 35-year-old toll booth attendant still living with his father who suffers from heart disease. Shy and withdrawn, he prefers to live in his own head rather than engaging with the people around him. He works at a busy toll station, and is known to talk to himself occasionally while working. As with everyone else, his relationship with his father is one of reserve and distance. During the day, Nurg\u00fcl takes care of Kenan\u2019s ailing father. In her early 30s, talkative and maternal, Nurg\u00fcl has known the family since her childhood, including Kenan\u2019s mother who died many years ago. Stuck between work and home, Kenan\u2019s humdrum life takes a dramatic turn when the newly appointed toll booth manager visits for supervision.\n"}
