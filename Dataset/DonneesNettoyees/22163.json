The fortunate man, potrayed by the Mexican comedian, Adalberto Martinez, a.k.a. Resortes, sleeps with other homeless people on the floor of a shelter. After living a day of luxury, he returns to the shelter to tell his friends that the life of a millionaire was not much different from their own; they ate, slept and worked whenever they wanted. The only difference was that the rich had ulcers. The moral of this story is that not all that glitters is gold and that sometimes you dream of having something and when you get it, it\u2019s not what you had expected.http://peliculasmexicanasdeoro.blogspot.com/2011/12/el-rey-de-mexico1956.html/\n"}
