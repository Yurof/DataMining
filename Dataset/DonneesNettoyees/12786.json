{"wikiId": "33956317", "titre": "The Catastrophe", "dateSortie": "", "duree": "15.0", "genre": ["Short Film", "Drama"], "resume": "The Catastrophe is a surreal drama/mystery short film that uses dreamlike imagery, a Bob Dylan song and a poem by Forough Farrokhzad to paint a portrait of Dominicus Pike, the quintessential modern man. The movie follows Dominicus as he traverses the American midwest, plying his trade as a cigar salesman, and his dawning realization that he may have sold his soul to a multinational corporation. The main story of The Catastrophe is interwoven with narrative threads involving the collapse of Dominicus\u2019 relationship with his girlfriend, Carlie, and his discovery of what may be a murder plot involving one of his clients, Mohammad \u201cDouble Apple\u201d Akbari. Only life on the road alone makes it hard for Dominicus to distinguish where reality ends and dreams begin.\n"}
