{"wikiId": "64291", "titre": "Lenny", "dateSortie": "1974-11-10", "duree": "111.0", "genre": ["Biography", "Black-and-white", "Period piece", "Drama", "Biopic [feature]", "Biographical film"], "resume": "The film jumps between various sections of Bruce's life, including scenes of when he was in his prime and the burned-out, strung-out performer who, in the twilight of his life, used his nightclub act to pour out his personal frustrations. We watch as up-and-coming Bruce courts his \"Shiksa goddess\", a stripper named Honey. With family responsibilities, Lenny is encouraged to do a \"safe\" act, but he cannot do it. Constantly in trouble for flouting obscenity laws, Lenny develops a near-messianic complex which fuels both his comedy genius and his talent for self-destruction. Worn out by a lifetime of tilting at Establishment windmills, Lenny Bruce dies of a morphine overdose in 1966.\n"}
