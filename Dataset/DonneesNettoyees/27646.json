This all changes one evening in Northern Ontario town Weedsville when Mattie overdoses on a stash of Dexter and Royce\u2019s drugs \u2014 drugs fronted by local drug kingpin and tough-guy Omar to sell in order to cover their previous drug debt. Thinking her dead and knowing that calling the cops would only land them in jail the pair decide to bury her in the boiler room of the closed drive-in theater where Royce used to work. The two set off to deal with Mattie\u2019s dead body. While the boys begin to dig a grave downstairs, a Satanic cult led by another former employee and  Abel enters the supposedly abandoned drive-in and begins a ritual involving pentagrams and human bloodletting in the upstairs concession stand. Their plan is to resurrect Jason Taylor  out of his coma. However, when Dexter walks in mid-sacrifice, everything goes awry. Dexter and Royce are captured, gagged and duct-taped and Mattie\u2019s corpse is discovered. But when some of the sacrificed follower\u2019s blood unexpectedly 'awakens' Matilda an all out chase ensues. Royce and Dexter get to her first, and the trio escapes. After safely stowing Mattie in Dexter\u2019s apartment, the boys run into Omar and his beefy sidekick Garry, who deliver a few swings of a curling stone and an ultimatum \u2014 debt  paid by last call or he will severely injure the pair. Knowing that millionaire Jason Taylor has a safe full of money at his place, Dexter and Royce take off to break in and steal it, a plan previously mentioned by Mattie, who knows the combination to Taylor's safe. With a few unexpected bumps along the way, such as running into, accidentally knocking out and then getting high the nephew of Taylor, who was housesitting, Dexter and Royce successfully manage to steal the safe. En route back to Dexter\u2019s apartment to grab Mattie, they run into Abel. A classic car chase causes our boys to seek refuge in a mall where they encounter a midget security guard named Martin. After winning his trust  he lets them leave without further trouble. Meanwhile at the New Age Resource Centre, Mattie  has been tied to an upside-down cross along with an unconscious Jason Taylor. Abel's plan is to offer Lucifer Mattie\u2019s life in exchange for Jason\u2019s. Dexter and Royce arrive to try and stop the ritual and rescue Mattie. Omar shows up looking to collect his debt and he brought Gary \u2014 and his gun \u2014 with him. In hot pursuit of Abel and his cult, Martin and his  diminutive friends arrive only to crash into Dex's car, propelling the safe from the trunk into the New Age Centre, crushing Abel. With Abel plan\u2019s ruined and his life saved, Taylor gives Dexter and Royce the okay to hand off the safe with all of his money to clear their debt to Omar. They happily flee the scene with Mattie in tow.MagPictures.com Retrieved 2009-11-04\n"}
