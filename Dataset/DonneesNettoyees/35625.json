A 1959 review of the film that appeared in the British trade journal Kinematography Weekly claimed that Lugosi played a \"vampiric doctor who experiments on young women in order to bring back to life his lovely wife.\" The review states the film incorporates clips from films made earlier in Lugosi\u2019s career, with footage featuring the Bowery Boys and \"some of the great favourites of yesteryear.\"\n"}
