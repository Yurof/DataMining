She increasingly resents the daily burden of violence and interaction with unmotivated students, even more so since the departure of her husband. During the rehearsal of a theatre play with one of her classes, she finds a gun in a student's bag. She struggles to grab the gun, and a shot is fired accidentally that injures the student's leg. Totally overwhelmed, she loses control and takes her class hostage, opportunistically creating a proper \u2014 although biased \u2014 teaching environment. While school officials, a negotiator, the SWAT team and high-ranking politicians outside try to figure out what is going on and how to react, Sonia forces the students to see things her way and ultimately shows them the contradictions in their own lives.\n"}
