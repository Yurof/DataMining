Brydie is a teenage girl who suffers arrested development after her involvement in a shooting accident. Though physically mature she retains the mentality and social connections of a teenager, and a fascination with dead animals and burial. Believing that she will be unable to survive without her dying mother the townsfolk fear commitment to an institution is inevitable. Her involvement with a young gypsy man, Roibin Krisenki  and later personal loss manage to at least partly resolve these mental issues.\n"}
