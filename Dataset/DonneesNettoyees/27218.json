Stanislas, a young anarchist poet who seeks to assassinate her, enters her room, wounded; he looks exactly like the dead king, and the Queen shelters him instead of handing him over to the police. She sees him as the welcome embodiment of her own death, calling him Azra\u00ebl . An ambiguous love develops between them, uniting them in a bid to outwit the machinations of the court politicians, represented by the Comte de Fo\u00ebhn, the chief of police, and \u00c9dith de Berg, the Queen's companion. In order to remain true to their ideals and to each other, the Queen and Stanislas have to play their parts in a bizarre private tragedy, which the world will never understand.\n"}
