At the same time, the rest of the gang crash a high-society dog conformation show where Farina is working as a page. The kids bring all manner of wild animal pets  into the show, and cause commotion and fear among the ritzy attendees. Because of the commotion the kids cause, Farina is fired. Meanwhile, Wheezer continues searching for his pups, who run toward a bell \u2014 any bell \u2014 they hear; he says, \"they think they're gonna get dinner.\" They hear a goat's bell, a fire engine bell, and a huge church bell, which Wheezer himself rings in a desperate attempt to find the pups. He sits on the curb dejected until the pups, who did hear it, scamper up to him for a happy reunion. Tying the two sub-plots together is a running gag in which first-time Our Ganger Dorothy DeBorba keeps jumping into a mud puddle, amusing the other children and irritating her mother, who keeps bathing her and changing her clothes. The last time this happens, she thinks it was Farina who pushed the little girl in \u2014 and falls in the mud herself.\n"}
