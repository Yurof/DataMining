Devin travels across America with his \u2018bro\u2019 Sebastian, who is making a documentary about his quest. Devin seeks to learn more about Rice from those who knew her, as a means of winning her hand in marriage. In New York, he receives counsel from his \u2018Best Bro\u2019, cult comedian Jim Norton. In Birmingham, Alabama, he speaks to Rice's childhood friends and visits the hospital where she was born. In Denver, Colorado, he meets some of her former teachers, and the one man to whom Rice has been engaged, Rick Upchurch. Upchurch tells Devin that Rice made an oath to God not to have sex before she got married, and deduces that her continued single status, and her enduring Christianity, confirm that she is still a virgin. In Los Angeles, he is given courtship advice by Adrian Grenier, and presented with a power ballad to send to Condi from Oscar nominated songwriter Carol Connors. When he arrives in Washington DC, he is assisted by Republican strategist Frank Luntz.\n"}
