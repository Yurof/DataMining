The latest manifestation of Z\u00e9lie's restless, capricious nature is heavy gambling, to Pierre's disapproval. He nags her about her habit, but is ignored. Having tamed Pierre, Z\u00e9lie now finds herself bored with him and starts to flirt openly with the wealthy Henri . Her dismissive attitude towards Pierre, coupled with her continual desire to put him down and belittle him, finally causes him to leave her and return once again to his old haunt, the White Coffin Club. The White Coffin is now ruled by Morel , and Pierre has to outwit him in order to reassert his dominance. In the process he attracts the devotion of barmaid Lisette .

Matters take a sinister turn when Z\u00e9lie is murdered during a party she is throwing for her society friends to celebrate her new association with Henri. The police believe they have evidence incriminating Pierre for the crime, and once again he finds himself pursued through the back streets of Paris by the forces of the law.
