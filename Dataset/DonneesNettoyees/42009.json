On hearing that Ir\u00e8ne's birthdate is 11 March 1977, the woman reads her horoscope : today she'll meet her true love, but she must be patient. After she leaves the metro, a young man sitting alongside  tells the older woman he was born on the same day and asks her to read the rest of the horoscope. The film then traces a range of characters of diverse ages, ethnicities and social status whose daily lives intersect with Ir\u00e8ne and Faudel's in a variety of ways and come together at the end of the day. Seemingly trivial events\u2014such as the throwing of stones or a shoe, the theft of a coffeemaker, a pigeon's consumption of a macaroon\u2014determine the decisions and lives of the many characters.\n"}
