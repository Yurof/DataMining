During her incarceration, Fantaghir\u00f2 encounters a creature made entirely of fruit, who claims to come from another world and to have been in the service of a new, dangerous enemy. Meanwhile, in a far away land, a cannibalistic pirate known only as \"Nameless\" attacks a peaceful kingdom with an army of fruit-men in order to kidnap and devour the inhabitant's children. His presence causes all edible items in the kingdom to animate and attack the inhabitants. In desperation, the good witch Asteria uses a magical mandrake root to save Fantaghir\u00f2 from the Black Witch and bring her to the kingdom. Fantaghir\u00f2 agrees to help, but is saddened because the magical root can no longer bring her back to her kingdom.\n"}
